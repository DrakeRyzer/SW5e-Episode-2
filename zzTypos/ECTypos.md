Backblast on scrapper operative

the following part of the feature is redundant:
Additionally, when a creature fails a saving throw against the burst or rapid property of a weapon you control and with which you are proficient, you can apply your Sneak Attack damage to one creature dealt damage in this way as long as that creature didn’t have advantage on the save.

as the change to rapid and burst alloes you to proc sneak attack against creatures using that property as long as they meet the normal sneak attack requirements

The new Path of the Corsair is missing the proficiency with two blasters the original draft had, but it still has an ability that can’t be used without proficiency in a blaster, which sentinels don’t get natively.

Either it should include blaster prof, or Remote Start should be changed not to rely on blaster prof, for the archetype to be whole. I recommend the first option. 

Edit: Actually, the first option is definitely the way to go, because I neglected to realize that all Corsairs currently in games are likely blaster-users right now, so taking that away would kick their play style in the shins. 

(Also, the original draft didn't require blaster proficiency for Remote Start, so it's even more odd that this version would both add a requirement for proficiency and take away that proficiency.)

Edit2: Apparently, Corsair will gain 3 blaster profs of their choice, and base sentinel will gain a new weapon prof Ideal, as a fix to this. Awesome. (edited)

For the Totem Specialist fighter archetype 

Totem vs Rune Knight. Rune Knight says the ability can transfer “the attack’s effects”, while Totem just says “the attack”. This can potentially make it more limiting than its source, arguably prohibiting the transfer of something like damage Sneak Attack or Dark Aura.

Additionally, you can extend your Force Deflection to a creature within 5 feet of you when they fail a saving throw.
This needs some clearer wording. "Extend" implies that both you and the other creature gain it, but does that mean it still requires you to make the saving throw (and fail it, in order to qualify for Force Deflection in the first place), or can you use it when only the other creature fails a saving throw? Or is this supposed to not be dual-target and only supposed to another creature with their saving throw?
