I didn't see any changes to Appendix A. Conditions when I checked the errata, so here are some typos I found:
The "Stalled" section is included twice. Delete the one listed before "Slowed"
SYSTEM DAMAGE
Some special abilities, or when certain conditions are met, cause a ship to sustain a special condition called system damage. such as and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called system damage. System damage is measured in six levels. An effect can give a starship one or more levels of system damage, as specified in the effect’s description.
^^^ This section has several typos and in general the first half is very awkwardly worded. I suggest the following edit:
Some special abilities or conditions, such as long-term exposure to freezing or scorching temperatures, can cause a ship to sustain system damage. System damage is measured in six levels. An effect can give a starship one or more levels of system damage, as specified in the effect’s description.
A ship suffers the effect of its current level of system damage as well as all lower levels. For example, a ship suffering level 2 system damage has 1 Slowed Level and disadvantage on ability checks.

## BoboNator — 07/14/2022 10:59 PM
Links in Appendix A that refer to “slowed level” link to the ground game's Slowed Level table (i.e. 15, 25, 30 feet) instead of the table for ships (150, 250, 300)
 Finishing maintenance Refitting reduces a ship’s system damage level by 1.

## J_Elliot — 07/17/2022 12:12 PM
Coordinator's Inspiring Display: "You grant a number of ships up to your proficiency bonus temporary hull points equal to your Charisma modifier." Should specify a minimum (probably 1?)

## BoboNator — 07/20/2022 9:10 PM
When you take the Evade action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any Attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker on your instruments, and you make Dexterity Saving Throws with advantage.

## RoboNator — 07/20/2022 9:18 PM
REGENERATE SHIELDS
You can attempt to regenerate your ship's shields faster, using one of its Shield Dice. When you take the Regenerate Shields action, you make a Strength (Boost) check (DC = 10 or half the ship’s missing shield points, whichever number is higher). On a failure, you roll the Shield Die twice and take the lesser amount.have disadvantage on the roll. On a success you roll the Shield Die normally.

Edited the disadvantage part's phrasing to match the Patch action

## Drake | Starship Lord — 08/09/2022 4:30 PM
DEFLECTION PLATING, MK III
Add/change. Not sure why this didn't occur to me earlier. (makes all 3 Mk III platings mirror the Armor Expert perks)
You substantially upgrade your ship's armor plating, you can add 3, rather than 2, to your AC if your ship has a Dexterity of 16 or higher and your ship no longer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Hide) checks caused by your armor's plating.
 
Makes that Mk III feel less meh

Equipment Chapter: Weapons

### Weapons
Ships have weapon categories based on their determined function. Most snubfighters use laser cannons, while gunships have both railguns and lasers. Specialized ships often carry torpedoes or missile batteries, or even a bomb deployer. In order to install a weapon, your ship must have a vacant fixed or turret Hardpoint modification.
 

## Drake | Starship Lord — 08/14/2022 4:45 PM
IMO, at least Hardpoint should be capitalized when it's called out as "Hardpoint modification" to drive home what it is specifically.

## Drake | Starship Lord — 09/02/2022 7:41 PM

These modifications should be un-fully capitalized in the code

Actually it appears that 2 other apostrophes in that section have been replaced with " - ". One in the first sentence of the Building the Millennium falcon step 2 bubble, and the last one is in the first sentence of the Variant: Customizing ability scores description

Change any reference to the Interfere Action with another word, as it shares that name with the Interfere Skill.

Scramble would be my suggestion

## Drake | Starship Lord — 09/12/2022 8:23 PM
Update DAMAGE RESISTANCE AND VULNERABILITY under CHAPTER 9: COMBAT to the below. SotG is still using the old wording.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after passive modifiers to damage, but before active modifiers. For example, a ship with resistance to kinetic damage, reinforced armor with a damage reduction of 6, and a Pilot with the Snap Roll tactic is hit by an attack that deals 22 kinetic damage. The 22 damage is first reduced by 6 and then halved, so the creature takes 8 damage. The Pilot uses the Snap Roll tactic with it's reaction to further reduce the damage taken and rolls a 4, finally taking only 5 damage.

## Drake | Starship Lord — 09/17/2022 8:38 PM
Part website bug, part should probably should be coded differently.

## Lythosyn — 09/17/2022 11:16 PM
The appendix A: conditions for starships has a few points that could be clarified

It alternates between referring to the affected entity as a "ship" and a "starship," it would likely be helpful to stick to one for clarity, in "invisible" it refers to the entity as a "creature" as well.

A few points where it refers to the ship, possibly instead of the deployed character, such as "A blinded ship can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that relies on sight or the ship’s sensors."
While the section that refers to ship's sensors makes sense, stating that a blinded ship can't see is possibly misleading or irrelevant information.

## Drake | Starship Lord — 09/18/2022 8:06 PM
Add to anything that lowers Turning speed (because the 50 turning limit is gone now) Such as the Combat Thruster mod line and any Deployment features
This modification/feature/whatever cannot bring your turning speed below 50.

I don't think everything should have the "if brought to 0, increase speed by 50" because that gets a little crazy, imo.

Alternatively add Flight and Turning sections undet Ch3 Starships, since they are now relevant to roles, and add the limit there

Expanded Payload should honestly just double Reload. Since installing another Hardpoint and Launcher would double the reload along with allowing for an alternative weapon. Also adding text.

Expanded Payload is a modification to a Hardpoint that doubles the reload value of a tertiary or quaternary weapon.

This clarifying text should also be added to other Weapon mods like Pinpointing addition, Shocking Rounds, etc, to clarify that they are being attached to a Hardpoint to upgrade it 

## Drake | Starship Lord — 09/23/2022 10:52 PM
Probably should put a limit on how many of a single type of weapon modification can be installed per hardpoint as well. 1 each should be good. (Can't installed 4 expanded payloads, for example)

Pilot deployment's 3rd rank ability Dependable Pilot says
"Starting at 3rd rank, when you would make a Dexterity (Maneuvering) check while assigned as a pilot"
This should be changed to helmsperson, since pilot isn't the term used for whoever's flying the ship.
(Or...kept the same, if we change all references to the helmsperson elsewhere to say pilot, and change the deployment name to ace. This once was vetoed, but we can still revisit the idea.)

Change "Astrogation"
Plotting a hyperspace course requires incredibly difficult calculations. Before jumping to hyperspace, a ship must plot a course via astrogation by completing 10 astrogation equations. When not under stress, a crewmember can take 10 minutes to carefully make these calculations and check them, resulting in automatic success. When under duress, such as in combat situations, a crewmember can calculate astronavigation with an Intelligence (Astrogation) check as an action on their turn, and then consults the Astrogation Results table.

Alternatively, you can direct a friendly creature that can hear you in attacking another target. If your ally attacks the target before the start of your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage. The Direct action can be taken multiple times on a ship’s turn.

Alternatively, you can direct an ally that can see or hear you in attacking a creature another target.
