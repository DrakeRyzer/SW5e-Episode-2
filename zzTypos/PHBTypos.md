Area Style and Mastery mention projector canisters (wrist launcher ammo), but not projector tanks (vapor projector ammo).

Debbie | Resident Magical Girl — 10/31/2022 10:04 PM
iirc that was because the vapor projector wasn't included in the PHB and thus can't be mentioned there 

Although I imagine when drake cracks the code and breaks into the PDF vault that can be fixed

The new wording on sentinel ideals is missing the part where it tells you when it recharges:
You adopt ideals that exemplify your bond with the Force. You adopt two ideals of your choice, as detailed at the end of the class description, and you adopt more at higher levels, as shown in the Ideals Known column of the sentinel table.

You can manifest your ideals a combined total of twice, and you can manifest them more times at higher levels as shown in the Ideal Manifests column of the sentinel table.

vs the old
You adopt ideals that exemplify your bond with the Force. You adopt two ideals of your choice, as detailed at the end of the class description. You adopt an additional ideal at 6th and 11th level. 
You can manifest your ideals a combined total of twice. You gain an additional use at 9th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

The new, reduced wording for the feature that grants an archetype at level 3 has proven to be confusing for new players who don’t have the older PHB or the DnD PHB for reference, making them think a class gets multiple archetypes, once at each of the listed levels, rather than one archetype at level 3 and additional features of that archetype at the subsequent levels. 

The new wording saves space, but not in a manner that retains the same information as before, and should be made more clear before the final update.

Aziz | Buildmaster — 11/04/2022 10:20 PM
Blindsight refers to player species that use it via “heightened senses”, citing Togruta and Verpine. These species actually use tremorsense, which functions differently to blindsight, and has no description in the PHB. The description for blindsight should be edited to not refer to Togruta and Verpine anymore. Tremorsense probably doesn’t need its own entry in the Adventuring chapter, though. (edited)

Blind Fighting mastery has 

Once per round, when a creature would have disadvantage on an attack roll against you due to being blinded, they must reroll one of the dice once.

probably wants to be 

Once per round, when a creature would have disadvantage on an attack roll against you due to being blinded, they must reroll one of the dice (your choice)once. 

that way it actually does something, because if your DM rolls and misses theres no point to using a reroll, and if it hits with one and you have them reroll, they'll always pick the die that missed to reroll, effectively doing nothing.

From Guardian's Aura of Conquest:
"Whenever a creature who is frightened of you starts its turn within 5 feet of you, its gains 4 slowed levels and takes psychic damage equal to half your guardian level."

First of all, that second "its" should be "it", but more importantly, there is no end specified for the slowed condition here, making it RAW a perma-slow. It should probably say "...gains 4 slowed levels until the start of its next turn" or "...as long as it is within your aura". (edited)

From Guardian's Aura of Hatred:
"You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you gain a bonus to the first melee weapon damage rolls you make each round equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1)."

J_Elliot — 02/19/2023 12:19 AM
From the Formfighting Mastery third benefit:
"Once on each of your turns, before you make a melee weapon attack, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you do so, and the attack hits, you can choose another creature within 5 feet of it. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage of the weapon’s type equal to twice your proficiency bonus."

The "within 5 feet of it" is obviously meant to refer to the target of the original attack, but that's not actually specified by the wording here. Also, I think it should probably also say "and within your reach", otherwise you could use this to hit a creature that is behind the original target and outside your weapon's reach.

Rick Fisto — 02/28/2023 10:41 AM
If you do that, you should have semicolons between the main categories, and commas to separate the pieces of the last category

Drake | Starship Lord — 02/28/2023 10:48 AM
Yeah, I think that's the correct way from my brief search. The examples didn't quite fit for what I was looking for

Jackety — 02/28/2023 11:06 AM
what elliot said works fine; this is just a product of the english language. breaking it down the grammar becomes
you are proficient with "simple blasters" "simple vibroblades" and "martial vibroblades that lack da da da da da..." 

i think the only thing you could change would be replacing the "and" in "and two-handed properties" with "or"  but it's unneeded
[11:07 AM]
semicolons could be used but aren't needed, unless you wanna make the formatting consistent and replace every comma in every proficiency listing with semicolons

(i would be in favor of that bc i love semicolons but it's kind of a time devourer)

Rick Fisto — 02/28/2023 1:09 PM
They are, in fact, needed.
[1:09 PM]
Lists within lists use semicolons and commas nested within semicolons

Jackety — 02/28/2023 1:38 PM
both the chicago manual of style and apa only use semicolons in nested lists when there is more than one nested list, iirc
[1:38 PM]
mind it's been a hot minute and i am rusty as hell
[1:42 PM]
this all said i'm down ready to always advocate for more semicolons 'coz i love'em to death, favorite punctuation 

but to change in there would mean to change it in every instance, or else you're setting up something where a reader is going to look at idk lemme find an example that's loosely similar (esp including Operative, which does not need it, but would require it for convention's sake, as would i think scout and ... a couple others?) 

and at that point you may as well just kill the comma

which like

gimmie the gun i'll pull the damn trigger myself
[1:42 PM]
(erm; more than one nested list meaning that within the list you have more than one list nested, my apologies for any lack of clarity)

Flaming Shots (level 2 power)
You channel tech power through a blaster weapon you are wielding. When a target takes damage from the chosen weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The power ends when twelve shots have been fired.

Overcharge Tech. When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the number of shots you can take with this power increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

It should either say "3rd level or higher" and "for each slot level above 2nd" or be clarified to work for "every two slot levels above 2nd"

Aziz | Buildmaster — 04/13/2023 3:49 PM
Can confirm. Flaming Shots is a buffed version of Flame Arrows, meant to be a 2nd-level power instead of a 3rd-level spell, and the Overcharge wording just still treats it like a 3rd-level is all. (edited)

Nightsister monk has a feature that lets it make "focus attacks". These are not weapon attacks, force attacks or tech attacks, they're an entire category unto themselves. Nightsister used to make force attacks, but this was changed because it's technically not a force power. These focus attacks don't synergize with anything, making them really awkward and out of place. I think these should be changed back to just force attacks; it's fine to have force/tech attacks not caused by force/tech powers, just like it's fine to have weapon attacks not caused by weapons.

(Granted, I'm pretty sure every feature that interacts with force attacks says "force attacks from a force power", so it still wouldn't synergize with those, but at least this opens up the possibility of interaction, as handwaving or changing those feature to work with any and all force attacks is still more likely than something new being made to specifically interact with Nightsister's focus attacks.)

When you use your bonus action to engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, before making an attack, you can choose to forgo one or more attacks made with that action. For each attack you forgo, you gain a +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

Saber Reflect says "If you reduce the damage to 0, you’re wielding a lightweapon or vibroweapon, and the damage is energy or ion, you can reflect the attack at a target within range as part of the same reaction." "Within range" implies within the range of the power, which doesn't make any sense to say here, as the power's range is self and the range of the attack is actually spelled out in the next line: "The attack has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet." "Within range" earlier in the power should be cut for clarity.
[5:17 PM]
Also, the first sentence of the same power says "In response to being attacked, you raise your weapon to attempt to deflect." This directly contradicts the power's casting time, which says that the power is cast "in response to being dealt damage by a ranged attack". I think the first sentence of the power is just meant to be flavor text, but the use of the mechanical term "attack" makes it confusing. (edited)

The description of Darkvision (Chapter 8) doesn't mention that you can see in dim light as if it were bright light 
Current text:
Many creatures in the worlds of Star Wars, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
This text is borrowed from an old version of D&D's PHB, this was later fixed in an errata

Additions and changes to  Damage Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. 

If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is reduced by half halved  against it (rounded down). 
(Probably best to just keep this the same as base 5e)

If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

~

~ For example, a creature with resistance to kinetic damage, a proficiency bonus of +4, and the Defense fighting mastery is hit by an attack that deals 25 kinetic damage. The 25 damage is first reduced by 4 **to 21, and then halved to 10.5 which is rounded down to 10, so the creature takes kinetic 10 damage. The creature also has the Shield Fighting Mastery(reduce the damage by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus)*, and uses its reaction to further reduce the damage taken by 4, finally taking only 6 damage.

Potential Change to the Mind Trap force power. Discussion here:
⁠dev-force-powers⁠

You attempt to trap the mind of your target in a psychic cage. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated, blinded, and deafened, and has a speed of 0 for the duration as its mind is trapped. It can think, but it can’t have any contact with or perceive the outside world. If the creature takes damage, it makes another Charisma save. On a success, the power ends. This power has no effect on constructs or droids.

Add to Falling
Rate of Falling
XGE p77
The rule for falling assumes that a creature immediately drops the entire distance when it falls. But what if a creature is at a high altitude when it falls, perhaps on the back of a griffon or on board an airship? Realistically, a fall from such a height can take more than a few seconds, extending past the end of the turn when the fall occurred. If you'd like high-altitude falls to be properly time-consuming, use the following optional rule.

When you fall from a great height, you instantly descend up to 500 feet. If you're still falling on your next turn, you descend up to 500 feet at the end of that turn. This process continues until the fall ends, either because you hit the ground or the fall is otherwise halted.

Flying Creatures and Falling
XGE p77
A flying creature in flight falls if it is knocked prone, if its speed is reduced to 0 feet, or if it otherwise loses the ability to move, unless it can hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as the fly spell.

If you'd like a flying creature to have a better chance of surviving a fall than a non-flying creature does, use this rule: subtract the creature's current flying speed from the distance it fell before calculating falling damage. This rule is helpful to a flier that is knocked prone but is still conscious and has a current flying speed that is greater than 0 feet. The rule is designed to simulate the creature flapping its wings furiously or taking similar measures to slow the velocity of its fall.

If you use the rule for rate of falling in the previous section, a flying creature descends 500 feet on the turn when it falls, just as other creatures do. But if that creature starts any of its later turns still falling and is prone, it can halt the fall on its turn by spending half its flying speed to counter the prone condition (as if it were standing up in midair).
