Less Typo, more addition to clarify.

Pg 71; ENHANCED ITEM CATEGORIES
Items that don't fall in one of the other categories are
considered adventuring gear. They might be worn
items, such as boots or a jetpack, or hand-held item
like a holocron. This category is a catch-all for for items
that don't fit in other categories. Some enhanced items specify the type of item
they are in their descriptions, such as a jetpack or
darkvision goggles, or the category in which they fall, such
as back or head. If an enhanced item
doesn't have specific a specific type, such as tools (fine), you may choose the
type or determine it randomly, such as Tinker's implements (fine).

If using them on unwilling targets mid-combat is intentional, it should produce a mitigated effect, as tossing booze or drugs in someone’s face is an inefficient delivery method that wastes product, compared to proper injection or consumption of the whole item.

Downtime Crafting - I believe any reference to 500cr should be lowered to 250cr? Since we have lowered the crafting speed from Xanathar's of 50gp (500cr) to 25g (250cr).
CRAFTING
A character who has the time, money, and necessary tools can use downtime to craft all sorts of equipment.

RESOURCES
Unlike other downtime activities, crafting takes a varying amount of time based on the value of the item being crafted. Crafting requires the tools appropriate to the item being crafted, as shown in the Item Specific Tools table on page ---. The character also needs raw materials equal to half of the item’s value. To determine how many days it takes to create an item, divide its value by 250. More experienced craftsmen can craft at a faster rate. A character can complete multiple items at a time if the items’ combined value no greater than twice the craftsman’s crafting rate. Items that cost more than 500 cr can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.

Casting Properties: Accessing reads
While using this item as your focus, you gain access to a number of new powers (chosen by the GM) of a combined total no greater than the access number. The powers count as known by you, and you can’t unlearn the powers.

I think the "combined total" is a strong indication that the word "level" is meant to be in here. IE, an accessing 3 focus doesn't just have 3 extra powers of any given levels, but would have something more like 1 power of level 3, or 3 powers of level 1, something like that. Maybe...

Boots of Hiding are an enhanced item with an effect that recharges when someone takes a short or long rest, but since they do not require attunement, there is no one for it to track the short/long rests of. They should either be changed to requiring attunement, or recharge at dawn instead of after a rest.

Add to our base rules for Enhanced Items, including a line about enhanced items such as grenades and medpacs, which have unenhanced/mundane versions, do qualify as Use an Object actions.
Activating an Item
Activating some magic items requires a user to do something special, such as holding the item and uttering a command word. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use the following rules for their activation.

If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn’t a function of the Use an Item action, so a feature such as the rogue’s Fast Hands can’t be used to activate the item.
