# Bows
Damage types are represented by icons: Bludgeoning for bludgeoning, Piercing for piercing and Slashinging for slashinging damage.

The 'longbows' presented here are consistent with the tabletop RPG concept of a longbow and represent 3 to 4-foot bows. A full sized, 6-foot english longbow is best treated as a greatbow.
