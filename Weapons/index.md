# Weapons
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools that you are most likely to use. Whether you favour a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The weapons tables show the most common weapons, their price and weight, the damage that they deal when they hit and any special properties that they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

When you are **unarmed**, you can fight in melee by making an unarmed strike, as shown in the martial unarmed weapon table. Unarmed strikes, be they punches, kicks, head-butts, or any similar forceful blow, count as weapons.

## Weapon Proficiency
Weapons are grouped into 10 categories.
* Axes
* Blades
* Bows
* Crossbows
* Flails
* Impact
* Improvised
* Polearms
* Simple
* Unarmed

Most people can use simple weapons effectively. These weapons include clubs, maces and other weapons that are often found in the hands of commoners.

Other weapon groups, such as axes, blades and polearms, require more specialised training. Most warriors use the weapons that put their fighting style and training to best use.

Each class starts with Proficency in an amount of weapon groups according to the table below.

| Class | Weapon Groups | Class | Weapon Groups |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Artificer | 4  | Paladin   | 8  |

| Druid     | 4  | Warlock   | 3  |
| Fighter   | 10 | Wizard    | 1  |
| Monk      | 6  |||

If you Multiclass, each Class gives Proficency in additional Weapon Groups according to the table below.
