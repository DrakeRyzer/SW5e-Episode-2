First and foremost, I have to thank the person who got me into D&D: my buddy, Ross. That playgroup was not great, but it started my journey.

Second, I have to thank the original guinea pigs of this conversion: Drew, Eric, and Rickey. It was comically bad, but we had fun with it.

Lastly, while I would love to say that I created *everything* in this conversion, that wouldn't be *entirely* true. The following people deserve credit as well:

### The SW5e Jedi Council
Aeryn for the awesome new podcast (with toddmoonbounce, of course)<br>
Bob the Builder for his work on strongholds and feats<br>
DarkMesa for writing almost as many archetypes as I have at this point<br>
DrakeRyzer for his work on polishing factions and ships<br>
Fynikz for his help overhauling and implementing new powers<br>
Grelite for all his help with editing and creation<br>
Heresy for their excellent work with species<br>
Hugehuman for his awesome help with archetypes and content<br>
Karbacca for the *epic* cover and SW5e logo<br>
Legobis for creating a whole bunch of monsters<br>
LordAelfric for the awesome theme<br>
Mishy for his excellent work on the Dawn of Defiance conversion<br>
Playking57 for his help with the artwork<br>
Speedreeder for the epic new website<br>
Stormchaser6 for his help with the Starships book<br>
Toddmoonbounce for his help getting the book ready for printing<br>
Tomato-andrew for his immense help with the enhanced items<br>
Tyrzaphir for the epic new character creator<br>
Vesh for making monsters and answering questions<br>
Zheadings for his help with content review and subreddit moderation<br>
