#### Atmospheric Decanting Vessel
_**Adventuring gear**, <font style="color:green">**premium**</font>_<br>
This metal jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty.

You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can open the jug as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.

Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.



| Liquid | Quantity |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Acid  | 8 ounces |
| Alcohol, strong  | 1 gallon |
| Alcohol, weak  | 4 gallons |
| Basic poison  | 1/2 ounce |

| Liquid | Quantity |
|:---:|:------------|
| Condiment | 2 gallons |
| Lubricant | 1 quart |
| Water, potable | 8 gallons |
| Water, stagnant | 12 gallons |



_Most liquids one might desire curiously only involve a handful of elements. This device collects a reservoir of them to recreate a selection of such liquids on demand._

#### Boots of Bounding

_**Requires attunement**_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** at least 3 levels in fighter_<br>
This item can hold a number of charges equal to half your fighter level (rounded up). When you complete a long rest, this item regains all missing charges. On your turn, you can expend 1 or more charges to engage the rocket boosters and leap to a space you can see. For each charge spent, you can move up to 10 feet. Any opportunity attacks you provoke with this movement are made with disadvantage.

When you reach 5th level in fighter, when you use your Action Surge feature, your movement speed is doubled for the turn, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn, though you fall if you end your speed in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft, and opportunity attacks made against you this turn have disadvantage.

When you reach 11th level in fighter, when you use your Indomitable feature, you have advantage on the roll.

The tech power uses the slot level, tech save DC, tech attack bonus, and techcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the tech power. The tech power cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

## Adventuring Gear (Forearms)



|	Item	|	Rarity |
|	:--	|	:--:	|
|	_Wrists_ 	                ||
|	&emsp;<font style="color:#4a5568">Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook</font>  | <font style="color:#4a5568">Standard</font> |
|	&emsp;<font style="color:green">Vambraces of the Outrider</font> | <font style="color:green">Premium</font> |

#### Vambraces of the Outrider
_**Adventuring gear** (forearms), <font style="color:blue">**prototype**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** at least 3 levels in scout_<br>
This item can hold a number of charges equal to half your scout level (rounded up). When you complete a long rest, this item regains all missing charges. When you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher, you can expend one or more charges to reduce the tech power's cost by 1 per charge spent, to a minimum of 1.

When you reach 5th level in scout, you can maintain two targets of your Ranger's Quarry feature, instead of one. Additionally, the reload value of the wrist launcher increases by 1, to 2.

When you reach 11th level in scout, when you are forced to make a concentration check by the target of your Ranger's Quarry, you have advantage on the check and add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. Additionally, the reload value of the wrist launcher increases by 1, to 3.

When you reach 17th level in scout, when you miss with a tech or weapon attack, the target takes damage equal to the attack's governing ability modifier. If the target of the attack is the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature, you can choose to deal your Ranger's Quarry damage as well. Additionally, the reload value of the wrist launcher increases by 1, to 4.

_This pair of matching vambraces are inlaid with the etched visage of an eagle. One contains an integrated wristpad, while the other contains an integrated wrist launcher._

#### Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook
_**Adventuring gear** (forearm), <font style="color:#4a5568">**standard**</font>_<br>
You craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this grappler, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.

A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a DC 13 Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.

While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.

_**Cybernetic augmentation** (enhancement), <font style="color:purple">**advanced**</font>_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Constitution 13_<br>
As an action, you can activate this augmentation to cast the _infiltrate_ tech power targeting yourself. Intelligence is your tech casting ability for this power, and if you cast it using this augmentation, it does not require concentration. 

**Side Effect:** While this augmentation is active, your speed is reduced by 10. Additionally, it fails to activate if you are submerged in water or other liquids.

_This internal augmentation can be activated to project a distortion field that bends visual light._

#### Armament and Defense Library
_**Cybernetic augmentation** (enhancement), <font style="color:blue">**prototype**</font>_<br>

You gain proficiency in all simple and martial weapons, all armor, and the Piloting skill. Additionally, when you make an Intelligence check to recall or discern information about a weapon, piece of armor, or a military vehicle that this library contains information on, you are considered proficient in the check.

**Side Effect:** This aggressively effective library can make it difficult to focus in stressful situations. You have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. Additionally, you have disadvantage on ability checks while concentrating on a power.

_This small and unassuming electronic module installed in the parietal lobe contains a massive library of information pertaining to weapons, armor, droids, and every other defense system known to the galaxy at large. Even rare or obscure pieces of technology are described here, offering a unique perspective on the universe - if you can handle it._

#### Darksaber
_**Weapon** (martial lightsaber), <font style="color:#dd6b20">**legendary**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this enhanced lightsaber. Additionally, the weapon ignores resistance to energy damage.

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to energy damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d6 energy damage from the hit.

_The Darksaber was an ancient and unique black-bladed lightsaber created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order. It features a distinctly Mandalorian hilt and an ominous black blade._

#### Inquisitor Saber 
_**Weapon** (any lightweapon), <font style="color:blue">**prototype**</font>_<br>
_**Requires attunement**_<br>
_**Prerequisite:** Double property_<br>
You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this enhanced weapon.

As a bonus action, you cause the lightsaber to rapidly spin. When you do so, you lose the +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon, but you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Additionally, while spinning, you have a 30-foot flying speed. While flying, if you take damage, you must make a concentration check as if concentrating on a power. On a failure, you immediately fall to the ground.

_These lightweapons, favored by the Jedi hunters known as Inquisitors, have the unique ability to rapidly spin, granting its wielder a limited flying ability._

#### Projector Canister, Corrosive (Average) 
_**Consumable** (ammunition), <font style="color:green">**premium**</font>_<br>
When triggered, this enhanced wrist launcher ammunition produces a spray of acid in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone. A single fuel canister holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 acid damage, and the first attack it makes before the end of its next turn has disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't disadvantaged. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. If you lack proficiency in the wrist launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.
