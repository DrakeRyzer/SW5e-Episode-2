## Miraluka and force sight
When playing a miraluka, or when you otherwise cast force sight, you gain the following benefits:
- Living things glow with the power of the Force. Those with an affinity for the light side glow blue, those with an affinity for the dark side glow red, and those with no attunement to either side of the Force glow yellow. How bright they glow is determined by how strong their connection to the Force is. (PHB 202)
- You gain blindsight to 30 feet. (PHB 202)
- You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight against living targets within 30 feet. (PHB 202)

### But what does blindsight mean?

Blindsight
- A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as Miraluka, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as Togruta or Verpine, have this sense. (PHB 176)
Blindsight means you don't have trouble seeing creatures due to darkness or dim light.

What does this mean?
Due to blindsight, you have do not have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight due to dim light or darkness against targets within 30 feet of you. 

In fact, due to the third bullet of force sight, you actually have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks against living creatures within 30 feet.

At all ranges, rather than seeing in traditional color, you see in shades of gray, except for the fact that living things glow.

How do attack rolls work?
Attacks have a total of three words that define how they function: for instance, melee weapon attack. Each word affects the rules for that attack.

1. The first word is always melee or ranged. 
- A melee attack can only made while within 5 feet of the target (unless a feature says otherwise, like the reach weapon property).
- A ranged attack can only be made against targets within a specified range, included in the weapon or power's description. Additionally, when a hostile target is within 5 feet of you while making a ranged attack, you have disadvantage on the attack roll (unless a feature says otherwise, like the Snapshot fighting style).
-- Occasionally, neither melee or ranged will be present in a feature about attacks. That means that feature applies to both melee and ranged attack rolls.

2. The second word is always weapon, force, tech, or ship (if you use the Starships expansion). 
- A weapon attack allows the attacker to add their proficiency bonus to the attack roll if they are proficient. You always add your Strength modifier to melee weapon attacks and your Dexterity modifier to ranged weapon attacks (unless a feature says otherwise, like the finesse weapon property). You always add your modifier to the damage roll (unless a feature says otherwise, like Two-Weapon Fighting). (PHB 190)
- A force attack always allows the attacker to add their proficiency bonus to the attack roll; if you have the forcecasting feature, you are proficient in all forcecasting attacks. You always add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier to force attacks, depending on the power's alignment. (PHB 196) You never add your modifier to the damage roll (unless a feature says otherwise, like Potent Lightning). (PHB 43).
- A tech attack always allows the attacker to add their proficiency bonus to the attack roll; if you have the techcasting feature, you are proficient in all techcasting attacks. You always add your Intelligence modifier to tech attacks. You never add your modifier to the damage roll (unless a feature says otherwise, like Adaptable Applications). (Expanded Content - Archetypes - Cybertech Engineering).
- A ship attack allows the attacker to add their proficiency bonus to the attack roll if they are proficient. You always add the ship's Wisdom modifier to ship attacks (unless a feature says otherwise, like the Calculating Gunner venture). You always add the ship's Strength to the damage roll (unless a feature says otherwise, like the Storming Gunner venture). (SotG 66)

3. The third word is always attack. An attack roll always involves rolling a d20, adding the relevant modifiers, and comparing to the target’s AC. If the total meets or exceeds the target’s AC, the attack is considered a hit.

Why is the lightsaber a simple weapon/why do lightsabers do less damage than [martial vibroweapon]/why are Jedi not overpowered!?!?!??!?!??!???!?!?
Whoa, now, slow your roll. Let's hit these one at a time:

1. Because people whined that consulars couldn't use the basic lightsaber despite the fact that you can change the names/flavor of weapons at your table.
2. Because weapons need to be balanced against eachother. If a simple lightweapon (lightsaber) is better than martial vibroweapons, then everyone is going to want to use lightsabers and completely negate the utility of an entire weapon category.
3. Because this game has to be balanced. If the three forcewielding classes are straight better than the other classes, then no one will play those classes. If it helps you to rationalize it, when comparing a level 3 guardian and a level 3 fighter, consider the fighter to be more "experienced" than the guardian despite them being at the same character level.

When I cast a power that requires an attack roll, and I have the Extra Attack feature, can I make an additional attack?
No. Casting a power requires you to take the Cast a Power action. Extra Attack requires you to take the Attack action. They are mutually exclusive. Read PHB Chapter 9: Actions in Combat for more information. 
Steev Palpatine⁶ | The Autocracy — 11/16/2020 10:31 AM
If I have Extra Attack, when I cast an at-will power that requires a weapon attack, such as lightning charge or sonic shot, can I attack twice?
No. Extra Attack only works when you take the Attack action. If you cast an at-will power that requires a weapon attack, you're taking the Cast a Power action. 
Steev Palpatine⁶ | The Autocracy — 12/02/2020 8:19 PM
If I have a feature that grants me movement, does it count towards my character's speed?
If an action, bonus action, or reaction allows you to move as part of its effects, this additional movement does not count towards your speed. If it does not require an action, however, it does count towards your speed.

For instance, if a creature uses the Ataru lightsaber form, since adopting that form uses a bonus action, it does not count towards the creature's speed. A Path of Focus sentinel's Blade Dance feature, however, does count since it doesn't use an action.

Where can I find the information about the companions themselves?
Currently, you can find them on the website under Rules -> Expanded Content -> Customization Options. Eventually, they will find their way to a book, as well as the tab for Characters.

Can droids benefit from Forcecasting Secrets features that treat force powers as tech powers, like Inquisitor scout and Artificer engineer?
Yes. Creatures with the Force-Insensitive special trait can benefit from these features, because they aren't learning the chosen force powers as force powers. Instead, they treat those powers entirely as tech powers, which means they could not cast them as force powers if they later gained the ability to do so. The same is true for creatures with the Tech-Impaired special trait and the Techcasting Secrets feature.
Steev Palpatine⁶ | The Autocracy — 02/06/2021 1:57 PM
Do I have to use my bonus action to adopt a lightsaber form every turn?
Each lightsaber form requires a bonus action to adopt. The effects of a lightsaber form last for the stated duration. If they don't list a duration, they occur instantaneously. 
Steev Palpatine⁶ | The Autocracy — 04/07/2021 9:11 AM
I have a d8 unarmed strike die, and I take Brawling Style or Brawling Mastery, does it become 2d4 or even 1d10?
Nope, which is why the die growth instructions stop at d8. Getting a larger unarmed strike die is excluded to monk and a few specific archetype features. 
How doe Brawling Style and Brawling Mastery interact with monk's unarmed strike damage from Martial Arts?
It doesn't. Monk's Martial Arts feature is a replacement die, rather than a growth die. Check out the Overlapping Features variant if you want to take that style or mastery. 
Steev Palpatine⁶ | The Autocracy — 04/15/2021 7:15 AM
I only have one value for Powers Known as a caster. How do I know how many at-will or 1st-level or higher powers I get?
Unlike 5e, it's a shared pool. You can choose any amount of either, as long as your combined total doesn't exceed your Powers Known.
Steev Palpatine⁶ | The Autocracy — 05/02/2021 3:32 PM
If I have a species with a natural unarmored defense and a class with an unarmored defense, do they stack? For instance, a wookie has 13 + Dex, and a monk has 10 + Dex + Wis/Cha, does a wookie monk have 13 + Dex + Wis/Cha?
Nope. You choose one or the other. There's a variant rule (Overlapping Features) that gives a minor reward if you have both.
Steev Palpatine⁶ | The Autocracy — 07/05/2021 1:09 PM
If I take the Attack action and I have Extra Attack, can I use my bonus action/reaction to TWF/DWF/Reload/Brawl/Dash between my two Attack action attacks?
If you could take the bonus action or reaction on your turn before or after taking the Attack action, and you have Extra Attack, you can do it between attacks during the Attack action. Therefore, because you could use your bonus action/reaction to Reload or Dash (assuming appropriate features allowing this), you can do so during your Attack action. Since TWF/DWF/Brawling require you to take the Attack action first, which means you couldn't engage in them before taking the Attack action, you can not break up your action to use these bonus actions. 
Steev Palpatine⁶ | The Autocracy — 07/11/2021 9:46 AM
If a class or archetype feature refers to class features, or has a level prerequisite, do those apply to any class feature, and does the level prerequisite account for total level?
Unless a class feature specifically cites otherwise, it only works for features granted by that class, and level requirements only work for levels in that class.

I don't know where to start? Can someone ELI5?
Read the Player's Handbook. Seriously. Everything you need to know to play is in there. 
But that will take too long. Where else can I start?
No. Read the Player's Handbook.

What counts as weapon damage dice/What is "normal weapon damage"?
Hand the weapon to Joe NPC. Have them shoot someone. What happens on a hit? That is the weapon damage dice/Normal weapon damage. 
Steev Palpatine⁶ | The Autocracy — 09/27/2021 3:35 PM
If I learn force or tech powers through an atypical means, such as a monk's Vow of the Devoted, or the Tech Dabbler feat, can I cast those features with force or tech points, as appropriate?
You sure can. Any feature that grants a power, be it a special trait, a class feature, or an enhanced item like a datacron, counts as a known power. You can cast that power using force or tech points as appropriate, and a force power counts as a prerequisite for later force powers you learn through other means. You can not, however, unlearn the chosen power through the normal leveling means of a class or archetype with native casting. Additionally, if the source of the power grants you a limited casting of that power, it can only be cast at its base level unless otherwise specified.

How do I generate my companion?
Every companion archetype has the following text as part of the companion-granting feature:
Create your droid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content.
Navigate to the Rules tab on the website, select the Expanded Content option from the dropdowns, and then navigate to Customization Options. Scroll down until you find the Companions section. Follow the instructions to generating a companion present there.
 Do humanoid companions choose a species?
No. Companions only get the traits determined by their nature and the features determined by their class. They get nothing else.

- Fighter Specialties?
- Guardian Foci?
- Monastic Orders?
- Operative Practices?
- Academic Pursuits?
- Scout Techniques?
- Sentinel Callings?
That's your subclass, which you choose at level 3 and offers additional features at levels that vary by class.

If I have two features that let me reroll one of the dice when I have advantage, can I reroll the same die twice?
Nope. The intent is you can only ever roll a maximum of four dice: The first d20, the advantage d20, your first reroll, and the second reroll (which can't reroll the same die as the first). Lines up perfectly with Compound Advantage, almost like it was planned... For instance, I have advantage and I roll and 11 and a 3. I reroll the 3 to a 6. I can't choose my second reroll on the 6; I can either stop rerolling, or try to reroll the 11.

"Is there a background that has x feat?"
Backgrounds are allowed to be fully customized. You are not locked in to the feature, proficiencies, and feat your background grants you. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, a total of two tool proficiencies or languages, and a feat that lacks a level requirement.
They can also be made from scratch, using the rules described in the Backgrounds chapter.

"Where are all the Jedi/Sith stat blocks?
"Has anyone made x statblock?"
1) Try searching through Aziz's Hypercodez
2) Try using discord's search :search: function, specifically in ⁠dev-snv-statblocks 

If you don't find any results with either method, that stat block has probably not been made and you can use ⁠dev-snv-statblocks to get assistance with making one.
