# **The Mando'ade**
The Mandalorians—known in Mando'a as the Mando'ade, or "Children of Mandalore"—were a nomadic group of clan-based people consisting of members from multiple species and multiple genders, all bound by a common culture. Every Mandalorian was combat trained and they could band together into an army on short notice.

***History.*** In their early years, Mandalorian culture revolved around battle, with war being a source of honor and pride in their community. The leader of the Mandalorians was known as the Mand'alor, translating to "Sole Ruler" and was rendered as "Mandalore" in Basic. Throughout their history, the Mandalorians were frequently allied with the Sith, perhaps most notably the Sith Lord Exar Kun, and held a certain distrust and general dislike for the Jedi Order. However, they would not hesitate to cooperate with the Jedi if a partnership between the two groups was mutually beneficial. In later years, the Mandalorians moved away from their obsessively war-like and conqueror ways and instead, most became bounty hunters and mercenaries, selling their skills to various individuals and factions in the galaxy. The Mandalorian Protectors sided with the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic.

***Six Actions.*** These six tenets defined what it meant to be a Mandalorian: 
1) Wearing armor
2) Speaking the Mandalorian language
3) Defending oneself along with one's family
4) Contributing to the welfare of your clan
5) Rallying to the Mand'alor when summoned
6) Raising one's children in the Mandalorian ways

***Armor.*** Known as beskar'gam, meaning "iron skin," Mandalorian armor not only provided protection for the wearer, but a common visual identity for any and all Mandalorians, regardless of species or gender.

The specific design of Mandalorian armor evolved over time, gaining more sophisticated features over the years. However, one of the armor's most lasting features was the T-shaped visor that adorned the helmet's face across its various incarnations. While sets of armor were often passed down from one generation to the next, beskar armor was considered the most valuable. The appearance of a Mandalorian's armor was largely up to the individual, being customized with different colored paint schemes, clan and unit sigils, personalized glyphs, or other marking patterns.

## Mandalorian Factions

### More incoming

### The Death Watch
The Death Watch was a Mandalorian terrorist splinter group of warriors that opposed the pacifist government of Mandalore. Following the end of the Mandalorian Civil War, the remaining Mandalorian martial traditionalists, who believed in the old warrior ways of Mandalore, were exiled to the moon of Concordia, where most of them were thought by the pacifistic New Mandalorians to have died out. 

However, the survivors eventually regrouped and began calling themselves the Death Watch. Whereas the Old Mandalorians did not seek vengeance on the New Mandalorians, the Death Watch intended to overthrow the pacifist government and restore the traditional warrior ways of their people. They were then led in secret by Concordia's governor, Pre Vizsla of Clan Vizsla, who wielded the Darksaber, and Duchess Satine Kryze's sister, Bo-Katan Kryze.

## Addtional Options

### Adding Beskar Armor
To add the effects of Beskar'gam to any mandalorian, add the Absorptive 1-3 armor property to any statblock.  <br>*Absorptive 1-3: When a creature takes damage from weapons, it is reduced by an amount equal to the absorptive number. If this would reduce the damage to 0, the damage is instead reduced to 1.*
 
Alternatively give them resistance to unenhanced or enhanced energy and kinetic damage, however the CR for every Mandalorian will go up by 2-4 CR.

### Special Equipment
This section is devoted to a comprehensive list of weapons, equipment, and other gadgets that any Mandalorian might have. Feel free as a GM to add these to any Mandalorian you use from this book to create more varied encounters.

Fill in any X with the mandalorian's attack or damage bonus as needed.

> ***Keen Hearing and Sight.*** The supercommando has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.
>
> ***Jetpack.*** Activating or deactivating the jetpack requires a bonus action and, while active, the supercommando has a flying speed of 30 feet. The jetpack lasts for a maximum of 10 minutes.
>
> ***Mandalorian Tech.*** The supercommando's heavy pistrol deals one extra die of damage and their weapons are enhanced.
>
> ***Moderately Armored.*** While wearing medium armor, the supercommando adds 3, rather than 2, to its AC (included) and no longer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
>
> ***Snapshot Master.*** The supercommando's ranged weapon attacks ignore one-quarter, half, and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of it. Additionally other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from the supercommando when they move to within 30 feet of it, and it can use its heavy pistol when making opportunity attacks.
>
> ### Actions 
> ***Multiattack.*** The supercommando makes three weapon attacks with its heavy pistol or vibrodagger and uses their jetpack rocket, wrist flamer, or wrist missile, if available.
>
> ***Heavy pistol.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 45/180 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8+4) energy damage.
>
> ***Vibrodagger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d4+4) kinetic damage.
>
> ***Jetpack Rocket (1/Day).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6+4) kinetic damage. The target and each creature within 15 feet must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. When firing a rocket at long range, creatures within the radius of the rocket’s explosion have advantage on the saving throw.
>
> ***Wrist Flamer (2/Day).*** Each creature in a 15-foot cone or 5-foot wide line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) fire damage or half as much on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
>
> ***Wrist Missile (2/Day)*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6+4) kinetic damage, and each creature within 5 feet must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) kinetic damage on a failed save, or half on a successful save.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Leadership.*** (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The supercommando can utter a special command or warning whenever a non-hostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d6 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the supercommando. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time.
