# Mand'alor
Mand'alor, rendered as Mandalore in Galactic Basic, was the title assumed by the sole leader of the Mandalorian people. Their Protectors established a balance of control in the Mandalorians' warrior clan society. At some point prior to the Clone Wars, a Mand'alor known as Mandalore The Great waged a series of conflicts against the Jedi Order. The Mandalorian Jedi, Tarre Vizsla, once ruled all of Mandalore, and a descendant, Pre Vizsla, leader of the Mandalorian splinter group Death Watch, took the title of Mand'alor during his takeover of Mandalore, the Mandalorian homeworld, but the title became vacant when Vizsla was killed in a duel with Maul.

During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the former Mandalorian super commando Gar Saxon, had wished to be Mand'alor and rule over the Mandalorians. The leader of the Protectors, Fenn Rau, claimed Saxon had no honor, thus Saxon was unable to claim the title. He was, however, installed as Viceroy of Mandalore by Emperor Palpatine. After Gar Saxon's death, his brother, Governor Tiber Saxon, succeeded him and wished to gain control of all of Mandalore, but was killed before he could achieve his goal after Sabine Wren returned to Mandalore with her clan and the Darksaber to free her father.

After Saxon's death, Sabine Wren passed down the Darksaber to Lady Bo-Katan Kryze, who accepted the Darksaber from Wren and with the support of clans Wren, Vizsla, Rook, Eldar, her own Clan Kryze, and the Protectors, represented by Rau, stepped into the role of Mand'alor to unite the Mandalorian people against the Empire.

## Prominent Mand'alors

### Tarre Vizsla
Tarre Vizsla was the first Mandalorian accepted into the Jedi Order of the Old Republic. During his time as a Jedi, Vizsla created the Darksaber, which was seen as a one of a kind lightsaber. Vizsla eventually became Mand'alor. After his passing, Vizsla was honored with a statue of himself on Mandalore. His darksaber was kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. However, it was stolen by members of House Vizsla. It was used by members of the House and Clan Vizsla to unify the people and strike down their enemies.

The Darksaber was an ancient and unique black-bladed lightsaber created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order, prior to 1019 BBY. The weapon was kept in the Jedi Temple after Vizsla's passing, but members of House Vizsla stole the saber in a conflict with the Jedi during the fall of the Old Republic. The Darksaber was passed down, generation to generation, by the ancestors of Pre Vizsla, who held onto the weapon even after the pacifist ideals of the New Mandalorians replaced the warrior ways of Mandalore.

### Pre Vizsla
Pre Vizsla was the leader of the terrorist Mandalorian faction known as Death Watch. Following Mandalore's Civil War, Vizsla became leader of Death Watch and attempted to overthrow the New Mandalorians' leadership in order to restore Mandalore's warrior past, seeing Duchess Satine as a tarnish to Mandalorians.

Vizsla's reign as Mand'alor was cut short when Maul and his brother broke out of prison with the former prime minister Almec. In the Sundari's Royal Palace's throne room, Maul challenged Vizsla for leadership, which Vizsla accepted and handled Maul his lightsaber. At first, Vizsla had the upper hand in his duel with Maul by using his jetpack and blasters. However, Maul was able to defeat Vizsla. Vizsla, accepting his defeat, gave Maul the darksaber and was beheaded in front of the Death Watch.

### Bo-Katan Kryze
During the subsequent civil war and the siege, Kryze was named Lady of House Kryze and Regent of Mandalore by the Jedi. However, the Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire, and Kryze was forced out of power by Clan Saxon. However, in 2 BBY, Kryze chose to ally her House with Clan Wren when they chose to resist the Empire. However, when Sabine Wren gave her the Darksaber, Kryze refused due to her failing as Regent. With Clan Wren, she was able to free Sabine's father Alrich Wren. Unfortunately, Kryze learned that the Empire, under Governor Tiber Saxon, had rebuilt the Arc Pulse Generator (a weapon designed to attack mandalorian beskar) that Sabine had designed and codenamed the *Duchess* after Kryze's sister. Despite wanting to punish Wren for creating the Weapon, Kryze knew that they needed her help to destroy it. Thus, Kryze, Sabine, and their allies boarded Saxon's Star Destroyer. Despite being briefly captured by Saxon and Captain Hark who wanted Wren to improve the *Duchess*. Fortunately, Wren was able to make the *Duchess* target Stormtrooper armor. Despite this development, Kryze convinced Wren to destroy it instead of using it against the Empire.

After the destruction of the *Duchess* and Saxon's star destroyer, Kryze regrouped with her forces. With support from the Protector Fenn Rau and the other clans, Kryze accepted the title Mand'alor and the Darksaber in honor of her people and her sister.
