# Chapter 2: Deployments

Adventurers are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can't stand against.

Deployments are roles your characters can fill that are not directly correlated with their class. A character can then specialize in a specific deployment, granting a variety of features, such as the gunner's gambits or the ace's tactics. As you progress in your deployment specialization, you gain more powerful features, and some features improve. Each deployment specialization entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every rank, and a detailed explanation of each one.

A character can fill multiple roles simultaneously, provided it can reach the appropriate equipment to utilize that deployment's features.

Unlike classes, when players achieve the space portion of the game, they start at rank 0. Players should attempt to experience multiple roles to see which suits them best before choosing the one in which they will specialize.

> When engaging in the space portion of a campaign, many class features work in conjunction with a ship deployment, while others don't. It is up to your GM to determine which is which.





##### Deployments

|Deployment  |Description|

## Ace
>Frantically, the human pilot jukes his x-wing from side-to-side,</span> trying desperately to shake his tail. In a last ditch effort, the pilot hauls back on the yolk, inverting his fighter, before quickly snapping off two proton torpedoes and vaporizing his opponent.

The sullustan maneuvers his B-Wing into position above the Star Destroyer's shield batteries before dropping his payload. As he turns his craft to flee, he takes one last glance over his shoulder, just in time to see the bombs detonate the shield generator in a massive eruption.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. The twi'lek pilot immediately takes evasive maneuvers, dodging the incoming volley, before giving her ship's line of fire on the offenders.

Regardless of their choice of career, their origin, and their species, all ace pilots share one thing in common; the love of flight. They thrive under pressure, be it a dogfight, a bombing run, or smuggler evading the law.





##### The Ace

| Rank | Feature |
|:---:|:---|
| 1st | Venture, Piloting Procedure |
| 2nd | I'll Try Spinning, Uncanny Dodge |
| 3rd | Dependable Pilot, Cunning Avoidance |
| 4th | That's a Good Trick, Evasion  |
| 5th | Paragon Pilot, Ace Extraordinaire |




### Venture
Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

### Piloting Procedure
Also at 1st rank, you learn tactics that are fueled by special dice called power dice.

#### Tactics
You learn two tactics of your choice, which are detailed under "Tactics" below. You can use only one tactic per turn, and you can only use each tactic once per round.

You learn an additional tactic at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new tactic, you can also replace one tactic you know with a different one.

#### Power Dice
A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the tactic.  

Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production.  These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of crewmembers.  Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.

### Tactics
The tactics are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Attack Pattern Delta
_**Power Die Location:** Engines_<br>
When your ship makes a ship attack while there is a friendly ship within 100 feet of you, you can expend a power die to grant advantage to the roll. If the attack hits, add the result of the die to the attack's damage roll.


#### Barrel Roll
_**Power Die Location:** Engines_<br>
When you are the target of an attack roll, you can expend a power die and attempt to maneuver out of the line of fire. Roll the die, take the result, and multiply it by 50. You immediately move that many feet in a direction of your choice. The orientation of your ship does not change.


<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/vmwsYtZ.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:4px;left:-110px;width:672px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' /> --->







#### Break the Lock
_**Power Die Location:** Engines_<br>
When the ship fails a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, as a reaction, you can expend a power die to attempt to recover. Roll the die and add the result to the saving throw.

#### Defense Screen
_**Power Die Location:** Engines_<br>
As a bonus action, you can expend a power die and take a defensive formation as long as there is a friendly ship within 100 feet of you. When you do so, your AC increases by the amount rolled on the die until the start of your next turn.

#### Skim the Surface
_**Power Die Location:** Engines_<br>
As a bonus action, you can expend a power die and attempt to fly through the space of a hostile ship. Roll the die, take the result, and multiply it by 50. Your ship's flying speed increases by that amount until the end of your turn. Additionally, moving through a hostile ship's space does not count as hostile terrain this turn.

#### Snap Roll
_**Power Die Location:** Engines_<br>
When you are hit by a ship attack, you can expend a power die and attempt to roll to mitigate the damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die.

#### Starship Charge
_**Power Die Location:** Engines_<br>
When you take the Ram action, you can expend a power die to increase the damage. On a failed save, the target ship takes additional kinetic damage equal to the amount rolled on the die + your ship's Strength modifier. Your ship has resistance to the additional damage dealt by this tactic.

#### Target Acquired
_**Power Die Location:** Engines_<br>
As a bonus action, you can expend a power die and hone in on a target you can see. The next attack roll made by your ship has advantage, and if the attack hits, add the result of the die to the attack's damage roll.

### I'll Try Spinning
At 2nd rank, when you use take the Dogfight action, you can choose to have all attacks against you from the target ship have disadvantage until the beginning of your ship's next turn.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.



### Uncanny Dodge
Also at 2nd rank, when an attacker that you can see hits your ship with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against your ship.

### Dependable Pilot
Starting at 3rd rank, when you would make a Dexterity (Maneuvering) check while assigned as a pilot, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your ranks in Ace.  You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Cunning Avoidance
Also at 3rd rank, once per round, when your ship is hit with a ship attack or fails a saving throw, you can make a Dexterity (Maneuvering) check, and instead use that value for your AC or saving throw.

### That's a Good Trick
At 4th rank, you can take a reaction to give disadvantage to an attack declared against your ship.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Evasion
Also at 4th rank, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When your ship is subjected to an effect, such as a proton torpedo or a seismic charge, that allows your ship to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on a saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Paragon Pilot
As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you would expend a power die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.

### Ace Extraordinaire
Also at 5th rank, you are a master at the helm. As a bonus action, you can harness your experience in a brief but awe-inspiring burst. Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on Dexterity (Maneuvering) checks, your ship has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against your ship have disadvantage.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.





## Coordinator
>The Mon Calamari admiral surveys the battlefield, noting the</span>  positioning of his outnumbered fleet. With a quick barking of orders, he directs his officers to relay that his fleet should prepare to converge on the opposing capital ship, with the knowledge that if they can disrupt the enemy's plans, their mission is complete.

The Sith Lord maneuvers his interceptor into formation with his apprentices. Communicating through encrypted channels, he directs them to move outward to flank their quarry. As they converge from the sides, the Sith launches a debilitating volley, disrupting his prey's systems and readying the ship for capture.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. As the twi'lek pilot begins evasive maneuvers, the human coordinator immediately jumps to action. He directs his crew towards their stations, while reaching out with the Force. As each of his respective crewmembers settles into their respective roles, he directs their actions to coincide, leading his team to victory.

Without coordination, many a ship would fall to disorganization and a chaos. It is the job of the coordinator to facilitate communication and teamwork, and to keep his ship, or fleet, productive.





##### The Coordinator

| Rank | Feature |
|:---:|:---|
| 1st | Venture, Coordinating Leadership |
| 2nd | Inspiring Display, Uplifting Directive |
| 3rd | Rallying Cry, Masterful Directive |
| 4th | Commanding Presence, Contingency Plan  |
| 5th | Paragon Coordinator, Leader Extraordinaire |




### Venture
Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

### Coordinating Leadership
Also at 1st rank, you learn collaborations that are fueled by special dice called power dice.

#### Collaborations
You learn two collaborations of your choice, which are detailed under "Collaborations" below. You can use only one collaboration per turn, and you can only use each collaboration once per round.

You learn an additional collaboration at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new collaboration, you can also replace one collaboration you know with a different one.

#### Power Dice
A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the collaboration.  

Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production.  These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of crewmembers.  Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.

### Collaborations
The collaborations are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Battle Stations
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
If you are surprised at the start of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can expend one power die to act normally. Additionally, on your first turn in combat, as a bonus action you can choose a number of creatures equal to the amount rolled on the power die who can see or hear you to act normally on their first turn.

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/yJ7rp4o.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:5px;left:60px;width:323px;z-index:1000' /> --->





#### Bolster
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
On your turn, you can use your action and expend one power die to bolster the resolve of the crew of your or another allied ship. That ship gains temporary hit points equal to the power die roll + your Charisma modifier.

#### Call for Backup
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
When a ship makes an attack roll against your ship, you can use your reaction and expend a power die and command another willing ally ship within 300 feet of the enemy ship to intercede. A crewmember on that allied ship manning a weapon station must use their reaction to do so. The enemy ship is then forced to make an attack on the ally ship instead. If the attack misses, the crewmember can immediately make a weapon attack against the enemy ship as a part of that same reaction. Roll the power die, and add the result to the ally's attack roll.

#### Head's Up
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
When you roll initiative and you are not surprised, you can expend a power die and add the number rolled to the initiative of any friendly ship including your own.

#### Incite
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
On your turn, you can use an action and expend one Power die to bolster the resolve of a crew on your or another allied ship who can see or hear you. The allied ship can add your ship's Charisma modifier to a number of damage rolls they make until the start of your next turn equal to the number rolled on the die.

#### Overwhelming Presence
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
As an action, you can make a Charisma (Impress) or Charisma (Menace) skill check and expend one power die to attempt to charm or frighten a humanoid creature who can see and perceive your ship within 600 feet. Add the power die to the roll. The target makes a contested Intelligence (Probe) check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you if you used Impress, or frightened of you if you used Menace, until the end of your next turn.

#### Steady As She Goes
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
As an action, you can expend one power die to strengthen your allies' defenses. Roll a power die. Until the end of your next turn, your ship and all allied ships within 500 feet of you when you use this action have a bonus to any saving throws they make equal to the amount rolled.



#### Watch Out
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
When a friendly ship, including your own, who can see or hear you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend a power die, adding the number rolled to the result of the saving throw. You can use this collaboration before or after making the saving throw, but before any effects of the saving throw are determined.

### Uplifting Directive
At 2nd rank, when you take the Direct action, roll a d20. Note the number on the d20. This becomes your uplifting directive number.

While you have an uplifting directive number, when an ally makes an ability check or attack roll affected by your Direct action, you can replace the result of a d20 roll with the value of the uplifting directive roll. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. You can only have one uplifting directive roll at a time, and you lose any unused uplifting directive rolls when you complete a short or long rest.

### Inspiring Display
Also at 2nd rank, you can inspire others through stirring words. You spend the next minute rallying your allies by giving an inspiring speech. You grant a number of ships up to your proficiency bonus temporary hull points equal to your Charisma modifier.  You also grant to a number of crewmembers up to your proficiency bonus from those ships one Inspiring Display die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Inspiring Display die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Inspiring Display die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Inspiring Display die at a time.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

Your Inspiring Display die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.

### Rallying Cry
At 3rd rank, as a bonus action, you can extend a rallying cry to those that can hear you. Choose a number of friendly creatures up to twice your Charisma modifier that can see or hear you. Each of those creatures gains an Inspiring Display die that lasts until the end of your next turn. 

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.





### Masterful Directive
Also at 3rd rank, when you roll your uplifting directive number as a part of the Direct action, you can use your bonus action to increase your uplifting directive number by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. If this would increase the value of your uplifting directive number to more than 20, it instead becomes 20.

### Commanding Presence
At 4th rank, you learn a new way to use your Inspiring Display. While aboard your ship, when a creature that can see or hear you fails an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use use your reaction to aid that creature provided it did not already have or use an Inspiring Display die this turn. The creature can then roll the die and add it to the result.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

### Contingency Plan
Also at 4th rank, while aboard your ship, you can choose two allies, instead of one, when you take the Direct action. 

### Paragon Coordinator
As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you would expend a Power die or an Inspiring Display die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.

### Leader Extraordinaire
You regain all expended uses of your Inspiring Display, Rallying Cry, and Commanding Presence features when you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when you roll an Uplifting Directive number, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Finally, when a creature uses an Inspiring Display die, they take the maximum instead of rolling.  Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Gunner
>The trandoshan bounty hunter hides in his assault craft</span> behind a nearby asteroid, patiently awaiting his prey. As it passes along its predetermined course, the trandoshan detonates the seismic charges, disintegrating the ship.

As the gunship moves away from its parent vessel, the zabrak soldier begins scoping out the opposing fleet. As the two forces engage, the gunner chooses his target, engaging his railgun. After its 3-second charge time, a massive blast of energy projects towards his target, vaporizing it instantly.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. The human runs to her gunning station, hops into the chair, and engages the controls. As her twi'lek pilot maneuvers the ship out of danger, the gunner draws a bead on the offending snubfighter, before unleashing a quick 1-2 volley and detonating them in a fiery blaze.

Whether coming from a military, criminal, or civilian background, all gunners share the same love of precise and effective destruction of their targets.





##### The Gunner

| Rank | Feature |
|:---:|:---|
| 1st | Venture, Gunner Techniques |
| 2nd | Gunning Style, Improved Critical |
| 3rd | Dependable Gunner, Brutal Critical |
| 4th | Gunning Mastery, Protean Gunner |
| 5th | Paragon Gunner, Maximum Power |



### Venture
Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

### Gunner Techniques
Also at 1st rank, you learn gambits that are fueled by special dice called power dice.

#### Gambits
You learn two gambits of your choice, which are detailed under "Gambits" below. Many gambits enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one gambit per attack, and you can only use each gambit once per turn.

You learn an additional gambit at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new gambit, you can also replace one gambit you know with a different one.

#### Power Dice
A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the gambit.  

Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production.  These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of crewmembers.  Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.

### Gambits
The gambits are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Crippling Shot
_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_<br>
When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one power die to cripple it. Add the power die to the attack's damage roll, and the target ship's flying speed is reduced by half until the end of their next turn.

<!--- <img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2d/8a/94/2d8a9425e55c8aac848a20149dcff584.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:22px;left:-38px;width:510px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(1);mix-blend-mode:multiply' /> --->








#### Disabling Shot
_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_<br>
When you make a ship attack roll against a ship, you can expend one power die to add it to the roll. On a hit, the ship has disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn.

#### Distracting Shot
_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_<br>
When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one power die to give your allies an opening. You add the power die to the attack's damage roll, and the next attack roll against the target by someone other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

#### Explosive Shot
_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_<br>
When you reduce a ship to 0 hit points, you can expend one power die and use a bonus action on your turn to make one additional ship attack against a different ship within range. If that attack hits, add the power die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Expose Weakness
_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_<br>
When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend a power die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.

#### Feinting Shot
_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_<br>
You can expend one power die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one ship within your primary weapon's normal range as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that ship. If that attack hits, add the power die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Penetrating Shot
_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_<br>
When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one power die to attempt to damage another ship with the same attack. Choose a second ship within 150 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second ship, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your power die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

#### Precision Shot
_**Power Die Location:** Weapons_<br>
When you make a ship attack roll against a ship, you can expend one power die to add it to the roll. If that attack hits, add the power die to the attack's damage roll. You can use this power before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.



### Gunning Style
At 2nd rank, you adopt a particular style of gunning as your specialty. Choose one of the Gunning Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Gunning Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Improved Critical
Also at 2nd rank, your critical hit range with primary and secondary weapons increases by 1, and when a ship rolls a 1 on a saving throw against a tertiary or quaternary weapon that you control, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.

### Dependable Gunner
Starting at 3rd rank, when you roll for damage with a ship weapon, you can reroll one of the dice, but you must use the new result.  You may use this feature a number of times equal to your ranks in gunner.  You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Brutal Critical
Also at 3rd rank, you can roll the weapon damage dice one additional time when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ship weapon.

### Gunning Mastery
At 4th rank, you master a particular style of gunning. Choose one of the Gunning Mastery options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Gunning Mastery option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Protean Gunner
Also at 4th rank, you can choose a second Gunning Style option.

### Paragon Gunner
At 5th rank, when you would expend a power die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.

Additionally, when you make a ship attack roll, you can choose to make the roll a critical hit. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Maximum Power
Also at 5th rank, when you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can deal maximum damage with that attack. 

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.






## Mechanic
>Flinching occasionally as a cannon blast slams into the ship, a</span> Chiss engineer quickly solders a large wire. He peers through his tinted goggles, ignoring the shouts of his ship captain as the enemy descends on their small vessel. Finally he shouts with pride as the repaired coupling powers up, causing the frigate to hum with energy. He gathers his tools and runs over to bypass the fried motivator. 

Sweat dripping down her brow, the Togrutan mechanic concentrates as she types furiously, trying a new inverter subroutine to eek out just a bit more power from her ship's main reactor.  As the whine from the fusion plant increases just a hair, she bites her lip and looks to the pressure gauge.  It's holding.  She gets on the comm and shout's to her captain, "Punch it!"  The ship lurches forward, the engines drawing heavily on the new reserves of power.  They were going to make it.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. In the cockpit, the sounds of a muffled explosion can be heard. With a shrill chirp, the droid engine tech whirls into action, rolling towards the source of the explosion. As it enters the engine room, it identifies the source of the explosion, and quickly moves to repair the damage.

While mechanics come from all walks of life, they all share one thing in common; they gather an immense satisfaction from keeping their ship running at peak efficiency.





##### The Mechanic

| Rank | Feature |
|:---:|:---|
| 1st | Venture, System Boost |
| 2nd | Quick Fixer, Ship Technician |
| 3rd | Dependable Tech, Reroute Power |
| 4th | Rapid Repairman, Efficient Reroute |
| 5th | Paragon Tech, Supreme Boost |




### Venture
Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

### System Boost
Also at 1st rank, you learn techniques to quickly augment different systems on your ship that are fueled by special dice called tech dice.

#### Techniques
You learn two techniques of your choice, which are detailed under "Techniques" below. You can use only one technique per turn, and you can only use each technique once per round.

You learn an additional technique at 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new technique, you can also replace one technique you know with a different one.

#### Tech Dice
Your techniques are represented by your tech die, the starting size of which is a d4. Using your tech die does not expend it.

Your tech die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd rank, a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.

#### Creative Thinking
If you roll a 1 on your tech die, it decreases by one die size until the end of your next turn. This represents you burning through your creativity. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 1, it becomes a d4. If it’s a d4 and you roll a 1, it becomes unusable until the end of your next turn.

Conversely, if you roll the maximum number on your tech die, it increases by one die size until the end of your next turn, up to a d12. This represents you having a creative break-through. For example, if you roll a 4 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6. If it's a d12 and you roll a 12, on future rolls until the end of your next turn, you can roll an extra die and choose which die to use. 

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/wsfIqqe.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-8px;left:18px;width:430px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' /> --->





### Techniques

The techniques are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Comms Boost
As a bonus action, you can roll a tech die and add it to the next Charisma (Interfere) check your ship makes before the end of your next turn.

#### Engine Tuning
As an action, you can roll your tech die.  Take the result of the die and multiply it by 50. The flying speed of your ship increases by this amount until the end of your next turn.

#### Power Distribution
As a bonus action, you can roll your tech die and move that number of power dice from their current location to another location.

#### Quiet Electronics
As a bonus action, you can roll a tech die and add it to the next Dexterity (Stealth) check your ship makes before the end of your next turn.

#### Reactor Boost
As an action, you can roll your tech die.  Your reactor immediately produces that many power dice that must be stored immediately based on your ship's power coupling.  For any power dice produced in excess of your ship's capacity to store, your ship takes that many hull points in damage.

Additionally, your ship must succeed on a Constitution (Regulation) check (DC = 10 + the number rolled on your tech die) or take hull damage equal to one hull die + your ship's strength modifier.

#### Sensor Boost
As a bonus action, you can roll a tech die and add it to the next Wisdom (Scan) or Intelligence (Probe) check your ship makes before the end of your next turn.

#### Shield Reinforcement
As a bonus action, you can roll your tech die.  Your shields immediately regenerate by the result of the die.

#### Weapon Overload
As a bonus action, you can roll your tech die.  The next time a ship weapon deals damage before the end of your next turn, it deals additional damage equal to the result of the die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

### Quick Fixer
At 2nd rank, when you take the Patch action or conduct ship repairs during recharging, you have advantage on the Constitution (Patch) check. If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

### Ship Mechanic
Also at 2nd rank, when installing new equipment or upgrades, you count as two members of a workforce, instead of one. 




### Dependable Tech
Starting at 3rd rank, you can regain use of your starting tech die as a reaction.  Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Reroute Power
Also at 3rd rank, as an action on each of your turns, you can reroute power between your ship's engines, shields, and weapons through use of the ship's power coupling. A power coupling can be toggled to neutral, where all three aspects function normally, or can divert power to a specific system. 

When diverting power to a system, the effects of that system are doubled: 
- **Engines:** A ship's flying speed is doubled.
- **Shields:** Shields take half damage and shield regeneration rate is doubled.
- **Weapons:** Weapons deal double damage. 

When diverting power to a system, power to the other systems is halved: 
- **Engines:** A ship's flying speed is reduced by half.
- **Shields:** Shields take double damage and shield regeneration rate reduced by half.
- **Weapons:** Ship weapon damage is reduced by half. 

### Rapid Repairman
At 4th rank, when you take the Patch action, you can choose to forgo your proficiently equipped bonus. If you succeed on the check, you can expend 2 Hull Dice, instead of one. For each Hull Die spent in this way, roll the die and add the ship's Constitution modifier to it.

### Efficient Reroute
Also at 4th rank, when you reroute power you only halve power to one other system of your choice.

### Paragon Tech
As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you make a Strength (Boost) check or a Constitution (Regulate) check, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Supreme Boost
As of 5th rank, you learn to briefly and massively boost your ship's system. When you use a technique that uses a bonus action, you can use another, different technique that also uses a bonus action this turn. Additionally, instead of rolling your Tech die for these uses, you can choose to take the maximum.

Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.







## Operator
>"*Watcher's Confidence*, please proceed to docking bay ninety-</span>four," comes over the freighter's speakers for a third time. Frantically, the chiss operator types as fast as he can, attempting to disguise his ship's transponder code and true designation. Finally, with a satisfied sigh and a single keystroke, he completes the new temporary identity to his ship.

Methodically, the voss operator types away on the datapad in front of her, one eye on the console and the other on her quarry. As she sees the ship's trajectory abruptly change, she completes her commands, overloading their systems. The ship immediately slows, it's turning become sluggish, enabling the voss to overtake it.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. The human operator immediately jumps into the co-pilot's seat and interfaces with the control panel. He engages a comm scrambler, disrupting the communications of the enemy ships, in an effort to diminish their coordination.

Operators share their love of a challenge; to overcome the obstacle that few others can comprehend. While they aren't always celebrated, operators are an integral part of any ship's crew.





##### The Operator

| Rank | Feature |
|:---:|:---|
| 1st | Venture, Operational Control |
| 2nd | System Disruption, Improved Interference |
| 3rd | Disrupted Defenses, Threat Assessment |
| 4th | Masterful Interference, Haywire |
| 5th | Paragon Operator, Overload Systems |






### Venture
Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

### Operational Control
Also at 1st rank, you learn disruptions that are fueled by special dice called power dice.

#### Disruptions
You learn two disruptions of your choice, which are detailed under "Disruptions" below. You can use only one disruption per turn, and you can only use each disruption once per round.

You learn an additional disruption at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new disruption, you can also replace one disruption you know with a different one.

#### Power Dice
A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the disruption.  

Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production.  These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of crewmembers.  Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your Disruptions require your target to make a saving throw to resist the disruption's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___



**Disruption save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your ship's Charisma modifier



___



### Disruptions
The collaborations are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Enhance Scopes
_**Power Die Location:** Sensors_<br>
As a bonus action, can expend one power die to increase the ranges of your ship's next primary or secondary weapon attack by 500 feet. If it hits, you add the power die to the attack’s damage roll.

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/vviMrnU.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:20px;left:60px;width:300px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' /> --->








#### Disarming Shot
_**Power Die Location:** Sensors_<br>
As an action, you can expend one power die to attempt to disarm the target. You add the power die to your ship's next attack roll.  On a hit, in addition to the normal damage taken, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you disable a weapon of the target ship of your choice until the ship recharges.

#### Hacked Communications
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
As an action, you may expend a power die, and choose any number of ships that you can see within 600 feet of you. Each ship must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take ionic damage equal to the number rolled on the die + your ship's Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Additionally, on a failed save, the ship's communication devices are disabled until rebooted.

#### Reactor Vulnerability
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
When a friendly ship, including your own, hits a ship with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die as a reaction to temporarily destabilize the ship's reactor. Add the number rolled to the damage of the weapon attack and the ship must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be shocked until the end of its next turn.

#### Remote Sensors
_**Power Die Location:** Sensors_<br>
Whenever you make a Wisdom (Scan) or an Intelligence (Probe) check, you can employ the aid of remote sensors by expending a power die, adding the number rolled to the check. You can use this maneuver before or after making the ability check, but before the results of the ability check are determined.

#### Sensor Blast
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
When a friendly ship, including your own, hits a target with a weapon attack, you can expend one power die as a reaction to attempt to saturate the target's sensors. You add the power die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than your ship until the end of your next turn.

#### Systems Block
_**Power Die Location:** Comms_<br>
When a friendly ship, including yuor own, makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction and expend a power die and add it to the attack roll. On a hit, the target’s next attack has disadvantage and it cannot regain shield points until the start of your next turn.



#### Targeted Strike
_**Power Die Location:** Sensors_<br>
When a friendly ship, including your own, makes an attack against a target, you can use your reaction to expend a power die. You add the power die to the attack roll, and the damage roll if it hits. You can use this maneuver before or after the attack roll, but before the GM determines whether or not the attack hits.


### System Disturbance
At 2nd rank, as a bonus action, you can choose a ship that you can see within 1,000 feet and target its systems for disturbance. For the next minute, or until you disturb another target, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Scan) or Intelligence (Probe) check you make to find it.

Additionally, when the ship makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to disturb the ship's functions. Roll a System Disturbance die, which is a d6, and subtract it from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. You can choose to use this feature after the ship makes its roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. You can use this feature twice. You gain another use of this feature at 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your System Disturbance die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.

### Improved Interference
Also at 2nd rank, when you take the Interfere action, you have advantage on the Charisma (Interfere) check. If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

### Disturbed Defenses
At 3rd rank, the first time the target of your System Disturbance takes damage each round, it takes additional damage equal to your System Disturbance die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

### Threat Assessment
Also at 3rd rank, as a bonus action, you can learn certain information about the capabilities of the target of your System Disturbance. The GM tells you if the ship is your ship's equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
- An ability score
- Armor Class
- Current total hull and shield points
- Total ship tiers (if any)
- Total deployment ranks (if any)





### Masterful Interference
At 4th rank, when you take the Interfere action, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you succeed on the check, the target has disadvantage on all ability checks or attack rolls it makes before the start of your next turn, instead of one.

### Haywire
Also at 4th rank, when you target a ship with your System Disturbance feature, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to Interfere checks). On a failed save, while it is the target of your System Disturbance feature, the first time it makes an attack roll or a saving throw each round, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

### Paragon Operator
As of 5th rank, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you would expend a Power die or a System Disturbance die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.

Additionally, you regain all expended uses of your System Disturbance feature when you finish a short or long rest.

Lastly, when you would make an Interfere, Scan, or Probe check, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Overload Systems
Also at 5th rank, you learn how to overload the systems of a ship remotely. As an action, you can attempt to breach the systems of the target of your System Disturbance. The ship must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to Interfere checks). On a failed save, the target's flying speed reduced by half, it's turning speed is doubled, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, it's shields no longer regenerate, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the ship's abilities, crew, or equipment, it can't make more than one attack during its turn.

The ship's pilot makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends.

Once you've use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Technician
>Flinching occasionally as a blaster bolt hits the nearby</span> bulkhead, a Sullustan defense coordinator quickly orders back-up troopers to his position. He peers through his infrared goggles, filtering out the clouds of smoke, ignoring the shouts of his falling comrades as the enemy advances. He raises his own blaster, yelling with anger as the weapon tears into the opposing force. His ship would not be overtaken from within.  

Staggering in time with the rocking ship, the ortolan technician rushes down the hallway, hanging wires obstructing her path. As she dodges and jumps over the impediments, she finally reaches the shield generator. With a quick twist of her hydrospanner and a graceless hit with a hammer, she opens the protective cover and reengages the ship's shields. The familiar hum as they power up brings a smile to her lips.

As the flag ship exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. On the bridge, the sounds of a muffled explosion can be heard. With practiced ease, the human shield technician jumps to action, calmly angling deflector shields to catch the salvo.  Within seconds, the impacts cease, the energy blasts coruscating off the invisible field.

While damage control <br>technicians come from<br> all walks of life, they all <br>share one thing; they<br> gain immense satis-<br>faction from keeping<br> their ship running.

### Venture
Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

### Defense Stratagems
Also at 1st rank, you learn stratagems that are fueled by special dice called power dice.

#### Stratagems
You learn two stratagems of your choice, which are detailed under "Stratagems" below. Many stratagems enhance a defense in some way. You can use only one gambit per attack, and you can only use each stratagem once per turn.

You learn an additional stratagem at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new stratagem, you can also replace one stratagem you know with a different one.

#### Power Dice
A power die is expended when you use it. Your ship must have a power die at the required system in order to use the stratagem.  

Your ship gains power dice based primarily on reactor production.  These power dice are stored in a central and/or system capacitors to power abilities of crewmembers.  Your power die type is determined by your ship tier.

### Stratagems
The stratagems are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Angle Deflector Shields
_**Power Die Location:** Shields_<br>
When you are hit by a ship attack, you can expend one power die as a reaction to redirect some of the impact. Reduce the damage absorbed by your shields by the amount rolled on the power die plus the ship's intelligence modifier.

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/JTxSRRC.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:8px;left:40px;width:435px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(1)' /> --->








#### Brace for Impact
_**Power Die Location:** Shields_<br>
When you are reduced to zero shields, as a reaction, you can expend a power die to instead reduce your shields to one.

#### Bring 'Em Back Up!
_**Power Die Location:** Shields_<br>
When you have no shields, as an action, you can expend one power die to expend a shield die to bring your shields back online with a value equal to your ship's regeneration rate plus the amount rolled on the power die.

#### Close Blast Doors
_**Power Die Location:** Shields_<br>
When you are hit by a ship attack, you can expend one power die as a reaction to mitigate some of the damage. Reduce the damage done to your hull by the amount rolled on the power die plus the ship's constitution modifier.

#### Countermeasures
_**Power Die Location:** Shields_<br>
When you fail a Dexterity Saving throw forced by a Ship weapon, you can expend one power die as a reaction. Until the start of your next turn, your ship has a bonus to dexterity saving throws equal to the amount rolled on the power die. This includes the triggering save.

#### I Need More Power!
_**Power Die Location:** Shields_<br>
When you use your action to regenerate your ship's shields, you can use a bonus action to expend a power die and add its result to the amount regenerated.

#### Intensify Shields
_**Power Die Location:** Shields_<br>
When you are hit by a ship attack, you can expend one power die as a reaction. Until the start of your next turn, your ship has a bonus to AC equal to the amount rolled on the power die. This includes the triggering attack.

#### Powerful Patch
_**Power Die Location:** Shields_<br>
As an action, you can expend one power die to use a hull dice and recover Hull Points.  You gain additional Hull Points equal to the amount rolled on the power die.




### Quick Regen
At 2nd rank, when you take the Boost Shields action, you have advantage on the Strength (Boost) check. If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

### Ship Technician
Also at 2nd rank, when installing new equipment or upgrades, you count as two members of a workforce, instead of one. 

### Dependable Damage Control
Starting at 3rd rank, when your ship would make a Constitution Saving throw, you can take take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. You may use this feature once before completing a short or long rest.

### Reroute Power
Additionally, when your ship's shields are fully depleted, you can use your reaction to immediately restore a number of shield points equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once you've used this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

### Rapid Repairman
At 4th rank, when you take the Patch action, you can choose to forgo your proficiently equipped bonus. If you succeed on the check, you can expend 2 Hull Dice, instead of one. For each Hull Die spent in this way, roll the die and add the ship's Constitution modifier to it.

### Last Resort
Also at 4th rank, when your ship makes a destruction saving throw, it adds its Constitution modifier to the roll (minimum of +1). Additionally, when you roll a ship's Hull Die to regain hull points or Shield Die to regain shield points, the minimum number of points it can regain from the roll equals twice the ship's constitution modifier (minimum of 2).

### Paragon of Defense
As of 5th rank, you are a paragon of your deployment. When you would expend a Power die, you can use a d4 instead of expending a die. You can only use this feature once per round.

Additionally, when you take the Boost Shields or Patch action, when you would roll to restore hull points or shield points, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll. Once you've used this feature, you must com-plete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Supreme Save
As of 5th rank, you learn how to quickly isolate massive damage on your ship. As a reaction, when you would otherwise be reduced to zero hull points, you can instead reduce your hull points to one.
