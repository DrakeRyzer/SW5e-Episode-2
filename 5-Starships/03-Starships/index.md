# Chapter 3: Starships

Characters are nothing without their ships, which serve as a great source of inspiration and motivation for their adventures. The starship can even be the adventure itself.
The first step is acquisition.

## Acquiring a Ship
Many parties might see fit to merely obtain passage on a vessel as a part of their adventures, and there's nothing wrong with that. Others will want to obtain their own ships as fast as possible as it is a core component to their character. It is at the discretion of the GM to determine when a party should obtain their first starship using one of the following options.

### Joining a Faction
Joining a large faction, such as the Galactic Republic or the Empire might merit the acquisition of a personal starship. Generally, the faction still owns the ship and allows the party to use it as long as they are in accordance with the faction's wishes. Refusing missions or violating the faction's rule may lead to disavowment, pursuit, and eventual repossession of the ship. 

### Shipjacking
The most nefarious (and frankly most enjoyable) way to acquire a starship is to steal one. Shipjacking is an old and extremely dangerous profession. Starport authorities (as well as the original owners) are constantly on the lookout for stolen ships, and if the heroes fail to adequately falsify documentation identifying themselves as the ship's owners, they can find themself in an uncomfortable position.

### Purchasing
The most common method of acquiring a ship is by purchasing. The cost of a brand new "stock" starship can be found below, on the **Starship Size Stock Cost** table.

#### Starship Size Stock Cost
| Starship Size | Tier 0 Cost&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|:----:|----:|
| Tiny  | 12,500 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Small  | 25,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Medium  | 75,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Large  | 500,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Huge | 100,000,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Gargantuan | 1,000,000,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|

How the players afford the ship varies as well. They may be patient, earning the credits to make the purchase over time. Alternatively, they might seek a backer, or a loan through a financial institution.

> Newly constructed starships come with a number of vacant modification slots, which can be filled with modifications, which are discussed in Chapter 4.


#### Financing
The party could seek a loan from a bank to purchase a starship. Generally, 20% of the starship's cost is required as a down payment, with monthly pay-ments equal to 2% of the cost for the following five years. 

#### A Wealthy Sponsor
Alternatively, the party may work for a wealthy individual or group, such as an aristocrat. Convincing such an individual to finance you, however, can be quite the adventure in-and-of itself. Can the party prove that the relationship will be mutually beneficial?

#### Loan Sharks
As a more dangerous option, a loan shark or an afflu-ent gangster could finance a ship. Usually requiring less money up front, this loan has steeper loan pay-ments (~10% of the total cost each month for 3 years).

### Building a Ship
Building a ship is generally cheaper than buying it, but takes time and necessitates use of a shipyard and a substantial workforce. If players elect to build a stock starship instead of purchasing one, it requires half the cost of the finished ship in facilities, raw materials, and labor.  The minimum workforce size is shown below on the **Starship Size Construction Workforce** table.  Ship construction also has a maximum practical workforce, beyond which no time gains are readily made.

#### Starship Size Construction Workforce
| Starship Size | Min. Workforce | Max. Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 3 | 18 |
| Small  | 5 | 30 |
| Medium  | 10 | 60 |
| Large  | 100 | 600 |
| Huge | 1,000 | 6,000 |
| Gargantuan | 10,000 | 60,000 |

Because workers generally craft at a rate of 250cr/day, the base time it takes to build a ship is:

___



**time (in days) = ("starship size stock cost") /<br> (500 x "size of workforce")**



___

For instance, to build a Small ship, with a workforce of 5, would take 20 days. To build a Huge ship, with a workforce of 1,000, however, would take 400 days [100,000,000 / (250 x 1,000)].

It is assumed each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.  A workforce more than double the min-imum workforce must work in shifts for further gains.

### STOCK MODIFICATIONS
At construction, your ship comes with a number of stock modifications that you can choose from. These modifications must be Grade: 0 modifications. Although they come without cost, they do count against your maximum modification slots and your maximum suite systems.





## Upgrading a Starship
Once the party has acquired a ship, they can add equipment and modifications to it and upgrade its basic systems. Upgrading a ship is a matter of workforce, time, and skill. This assumes the starship you are upgrading has no missing hull points or damaged systems, the requisite resources and tools are freely available, and you are docked at a spaceport or shipyard. Under less optimal conditions the time, money, and skill required could be increased by as much as 100%, or be ruled impossible by the GM.

### Upgrading a Ship's Tier
In addition to the cost of modifications and equipment, players can invest credits into their starship's basic systems, increasing the tier of the ship. As a player increases the tier of their starship, they unlock add-itional Hull and Shield Dice, and unique size-specific features. The material and personnel costs in credits that a party must invest in their ship varies based on the tier they are trying to obtain, as show below in the **Base Upgrade Cost by Tier** table. The costs detailed here include hiring the required workforce. However, if PCs can provide the workforce directly and invest their time, the final costs incurred are only half that shown.

#### Base Upgrade Cost by Tier
| Tier | Cost in Credits | Description of Rarity |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| 0 | 0         | Mass Production<br> (Standard) |
| 1 | 3,900     | Modified <br>(Premium) |
| 2 | 77,500    | Fully Customized <br>(Prototype) |
| 3 | 297,000   | Highly Sophisticated Engineering (Advanced) |
| 4 | 620,000   | State of the Art<br> (Legendary) |
| 5 | 1,150,000 | Unique<br> (Artifact) |

### Cost Modifiers
It costs more to upgrade the hull of a capital ship than the hull of a starfighter; bigger starships are simply costlier to improve. Consequently, each starship has a cost modifier depending on the ship's size, as shown in the **Starship Size Upgrade Cost** table below, which is multiplied by the value for that tier in the **Base Upgrade Cost by Tier** table.

#### Starship Size Upgrade Cost
| Starship Size | Cost Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  |&emsp;&emsp;x 0.5 |
| Small |&emsp;&emsp;x 1 |
| Medium |&emsp;&emsp;x 2 |
| Large |&emsp;&emsp;x 10 |
| Huge |&emsp;&emsp;x 100 |
| Gargantuan |&emsp;&emsp;x 1,000 | 
 



For instance, to upgrade a Small size ship from Tier 0 to Tier 1, it costs 3,900 credits. To upgrade a Huge size ship from Tier 2 to Tier 3, however, it costs 29,700,000 (297,000 x 100).



### Upgrade Workforce
Additionally, bigger ships require more people to perform these upgrades. For a Small ship, a single person can do everything necessary (though additional workers will reduce the time taken), while a Medium or larger ship requires a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the **Starship Size Upgrade Workforce** table below.

#### Starship Size Upgrade Workforce
| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 1 |
| Small  | 1 |
| Medium  | 5 |
| Large  | 50 |
| Huge | 500 |
| Gargantuan | 5,000 |

### Upgrade Time
With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter can be upgraded in no more than a week's time. However, upgrading a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to upgrade a starship is calculated as follows:

___



**time (in days) = ("base upgrade cost by tier" x "starship size upgrade cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**



___

For instance, to upgrade a Small size ship from tier 0 to tier 1, with a workforce of 3, would take 2.6 days. To upgrade a Huge size ship from Tier 2 to Tier 3, with a workforce of 500, however, would take 118.8 days [(297,000 x 100) / (500 x 500)].

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

> Starship features are generally only usable once per round. Once they have been used by a crewmember, they are not available for use again until the start of that crewmember's next turn.

### Starship Tier Features
Once players have upgraded a ship to tier 1 or higher, they unlock additional features, determined by the ship's size. 

Tier features that grant modifications come at no cost and do not take up a modification slot or count against your ship's Suite Capacity unless otherwise stated.





### Roles
At Tier 0, Tier 2, and Tier 4, you will have your choice of abilities to add to your ship by choosing a Role.  These choices allow your ship to become more specialized by gaining an ability exclusive to that Role. 

At ship construction (Tier 0), your choice of Role grants one or more Ability Score Increases, a base Speed and Turning Speed (see **Chapter 7: Adventuring** for rules on Speed and Turning Speed), and stock equipment.  This stock equipment, like all equipment, may be removed and/or replaced using the rules found in **Chapter 5: Equipment**.

> #### VARIANT: STARTING EQUIPMENT
>
> In lieu of the equipment granted by your ship's chosen Role, with your Game Master's permission, you can elect to choose your starting equipment. If you do so, you may substitute equipment of the same category for that given by your Role at Tier 0.  For example, you may choose any one of each of the following for a new ship in lieu of that given by your chosen Tier 0 Role:
>
> - (a) deflection armor (b) lightweight armor (c) or reinforced armor
> - (a) fuel cell reactor (b) ionization reactor (c) or power core reactor
> - (a) direct power coupling (b) distributed power coupling (c) or hub & spoke power coupling
>
> Additionally, for Large or Larger ships you may also choose one of the following:
>
> - (a) directional shield (b) fortress shield (c) or quick-charge shield


At each of these tiers you may choose a new Role.  For example, when your advance to Tier 2 with your small ship, you may choose to gain the Attack Fighter bonus ("your ship gains a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and save DCs of its ship weapons.") even though, at Tier 0, you had chosen the Shuttle role (granting a +1 to Constitution, various starting equipment, and a base speed/turning speed pair).




> #### First Time on a Ship?
>
> For your first time playing on a starship, it is recommended that you ignore Deployment abilities (characters new to ships typically have no Ranks in any Deployments).  This means you will, therefore, be ignoring Reactors and Power Couplings, since these are the parts of the ship responsible for generating and storing the Power Dice that fuel your Deployment abilities.
>
> New players and GMs, even after adding Deployments (and therefore Power Dice) to their games, may still prefer to play on "Easy Mode."  To keep things as simple as possible, choose a **Fuel Cell Reactor** (which automatically regenerates one Power Die per ship turn) and a **Direct Coupling** (which allows players to ignore which system their Deployment abilities draw Power Dice from, at the cost of fewer maximum dice to use). Additionally, you can leave shields off of your ship completely or, if you decide to include shields for survivability, choose **Directional Shields** for simplicity.

### Hull Dice
Your ship starts play with one or more Hull Dice, which are analogous to Hit Dice in the ground game.  Tiny ships start with one Hull Die, a d4, while all other sizes of ship start with more than one Hull Die.  For example, a Tier 0 Small ship starts play with 3 Hull Dice, each a d6.  This is analogous to a level 3 character in the ground game.  

In order to calculate the ship's starting Hull Points, you take the maximum of the first die (in this case 6) and add the ship's Constitution modifier, and then roll the two remaining Hull Dice (or take the average: 4) and add the ship's Constitution modifier to each roll. 

### Shield Dice
Not all ships have shields, but if your ship has Shields, its Shield Dice are determined by its size and Tier.  For detailed information on Shields, see **Chapter 5: Equipment**.

## Tiny Ships

As the droid fighter ducked and weaved through flying blaster bolts and dodged the occasional flak, its optical sensors continued to become more and more occluded as they accumulated a dark haze of dust and smoke.  Switching to active radar systems, the droid continued to relentlessly pursue its target: the fleeing Jedi and its small padawn that was barely larger than a youngling. Not that it mattered.  Whether either target continued to draw breath a few seconds from now didn't really matter to the droid.  Of course, that cessation was its goal, but it didn't really care about that goal...it's just what it was doing.  What it had to do.  But not exactly what it *wanted* to do.  The droid passed power from its fully charged weapon's capacitors into its guns, which blazed to life and spewed plasma towards the small child's back.  It was a perfect shot.  How could it not be.  That's what it did.  Then the Jedi's own plasma weapon flared as it darted across the youngling's back, deflecting the droid's blasts directly back at it.  Of course, *that* is what *Jedi's* did.  And as the bolts tore through the droid ship's hull, into its main computer banks, across its power banks and out its engines, the droid's final computations let it know that it was plummeting to the earth at terminal velocity.  It's just what it was doing.  What it now had to do.  But not exactly what it *wanted* to do.




The small drone slips silently past the blockade, scanning the defensive formations as it goes.  The only chance to save the people on embattled Neth-Feeno was to coordinate a supply drop with them.  This little, remote-controlled stealth ship was their only hope.  It had to reach the surface to get the plan and maps through.  Then it had to return with a full readout of the defenses.  Only then could a distracting assault be planned to cover the air drop.  As the tiny craft floated past the final sensor pod mounted right next to the final turret canon, the monitoring crew let out a sigh, and wiped sweat from their brows.  As their screens, already more static than signal, winked out as the craft's transmissions were cut-off as it passed completely into the black-out zone, the team leader turned to his squad and said, "May the force be with us today."

One thing all Tiny starships have in common is that they are unmanned. Sometimes they are controlled remotely, but more often they are controlled by droids.

### Starship Improvements
Beginning when your ship reaches 1st tier, it gains the following benefits:

#### Ability Score Improvement
At first tier, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier, you can increase one of your ship's ability scores by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. You can't increase your ability scores other than Dexterity above 20, or your Dexterity above 24, with this feature.

#### Additional Hull and Shield Dice
Your ship gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die. It gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die at 2nd tier (2, each), 3rd tier (3, each), 4th tier (4, each), and 5th tier (5, each).

#### ARMOR CLASS UPGRADE
Beginning at second Tier, your ship's armor class improves, giving your ship a +1 to its AC. It gains an additional +1 bonus to AC at 3rd Tier (+2 total), 4th Tier (+3 total), and 5th Tier (+4 total).


### Swarm Tactics
Also at 1st tier, your starship is most effective when working in groups.

Your ship makes the most of every opportunity provided by allies. When your designated pilot would make an attack roll against a larger ship, and there is an allied ship within 200 feet of your target, they can roll a Swarm Tactics die, which is a d4, and add it to the attack roll. You can do this after the roll is made, but before the result is known.

Your ship's Swarm Tactics die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.

### Role Specialization
At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose any one from the following:

#### Droid
Your ship gains the Droid Brain, Makeshift and Droid Brain, Mk I modifications at no cost.  

Additionally, on your ship's turn, it can take one additional action on top of its regular actions.  Once this feature has been used, your ship must recharge before it can use it again.

#### Munition
Your ship gains the Hardened Prow modification at no cost.  

Additionally, when you deal damage on a ram, the damage you inflict on other ships increases by +2 per hull die of your ship.



#### Predator
Once per turn, your ship can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one ship it hits with a primary weapon if your ship has advantage on the attack roll. This damage is the same as the weapon’s damage, and the attack must use a weapon without a constitution requirement.

Your ship doesn’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 50 feet of it, that enemy isn’t disabled, and your ship doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll

#### Probe
Your ship gains the Scanner, Mk I modification at no cost.  

Additionally, when your ship attacks a ship or creature it can’t see, its inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on its attack rolls against it.

#### Satellite
Your ship gains the Comms Package, Mk I modification at no cost.

Additionally, you can take the Interfere action as a bonus action.

#### Worker
Your ship gains the Tractor Beam modification at no cost.

Additionally, your ship is treated as a medium ship for purposes of this modification.

### Nimble Aerobatics
Also at 2nd tier, your ship is so nimble that it can ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when it you would use an action to break free of an effect that is tractoring or otherwise restraining your ship, you can instead use a bonus action.


### Uncanny Dodge
At 3rd tier, your ship's agility lets it dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When your ship is subjected to an effect, such as a proton torpedo or a seismic charge, that allows your ship to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on a saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Swarm Defense
Also at 3rd tier, your ship further benefits from being surrounded by allies. Your ship gains a bonus its to AC equal to number of allied ships within 100 feet of it. The bonus has a maximum value equal to your ship's tier (rounded up).





### Role Specialization
At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose any one from the following.

#### Droid
Your ship gains the Droid Brain, Mk II modification at no cost.  

Additionally, your ship can take a second reaction each round. It can only take one reaction per turn.

#### Munition
Your ship gains the Self-Destruct Mechanism modification at no cost.

Additionally, when you deal damage upon self-destruction, the damage you inflict on other ships increases by +2 per hull die of your ship.


#### Predator
Your ship deals 1d6 additional damage when it scores a critical hit with an attack.

#### Probe
Your ship gains the Stealth Device modification at no cost.

Additionally, when your ship attempts to conceal on its turn, it can opt to not move on that turn causing creatures that attempt to detect your ship to take a -10 penalty to their Wisdom (Scan) checks until the start of your ship's next turn. Your ship loses this benefit if it moves, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. 

#### Satellite
Your ship gains the Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk I and Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk II modifications at no cost.

Additionally, the range of these modifications is 1200 feet.

#### Worker
Your ship gains the Tractor Beam Heavy Capacitors modification at no cost.

Additionally, your ship is treated as a medium ship for purposes of this modification.


### Elusive Target
Also at 4th tier, the size and agility of your ship makes it easy to avoid attacks. No primary weapon attacks made against your ship can benefit from advantage while your ship is not disabled.


### Paragon Swarmer
As of 5th Tier, your starship is the best in its class. Choose from the following:

#### Droid
Your ship’s Intelligence score increases by 2. It’s maximum for this score increases by 2.

#### Munition
Your ship’s Constitution score increases by 2. It’s maximum for this score increases by 2.

#### Predator
Your ship’s Dexterity score increases by 2. It’s maximum for this score increases by 2.

#### Probe
Your ship’s Wisdom score increases by 2. It’s maximum for this score increases by 2.

#### Satellite
Your ship’s Charisma score increases by 2. It’s maximum for this score increases by 2.

#### Worker
Your ship’s Strength score increases by 2. It’s maximum for this score increases by 2.

### Keen Accuracy
At 5th tier, the critical hit range of your ship's weapons increases by 1.

## Small Ships
As the fighters cover his approach, Zik Beskin activates his targeting computer and ignores the explosions surrounding him, instead Focusing on the Destroyer's shield generator.  It had to come down soon, or this fight was lost. Arsix, behind him, beeps and whirs, preparing the ion pulse missiles for the attack run, pre-warming their engines and arming the warheads.  Together a long time now, Beskin and Arsix had spilled their share of blood and oil, respectively, for the Rebellion--usually just while improving their ancient Y-wing. But today, the blood and oil spilt wouldn't be their own.  As Zik let fly a pair of missiles, he knew they would find their target. Today wasn't over just yet.

 

This was her fourth sortie of the day, and Sheena was tired.  The terrorists just kept coming.  Every time she was about to shut her eyes a new wave of the Rebels came.  And every time they did, she rushed to her TIE Interceptor and joined the alert fighters to take the fighters down before they could blow a hole in the planet's defenses.  Every time they retreated before suffering heavy losses.  But every time they came back.  This last time she had decided to just nap in the cramped cockpit, so when the claxon rang out, she and her ship were basically ready to fly.  This time she was go-ing to end them quickly.  As she repeatedly squeezed her trigger, she executed Koiogran turns and snap rolls galore, her laser blasts striking true, and the debris of A-wings, X-wings, and B-Wings--along with some frozen traitor remains--floated in space the next few days.  At night, she leaned back against her beau, sipping some wine and watch-ing the beautiful streaks of light cross the sky as, piece by piece, the wreckage burned up in the atmosphere during reentry.

R5-S1 locked down the loose stabilizer with his gripper arm as he angled the X-Wing's deflector shields.  This ship took a firm gripper to get under control, but R5-S1 was up to the task.  As his pilot, Veets, fired his last blast from the overheating cannons on the deployed s-foils, R5-S1 did the work of cooling off the guns, spooling up the hyperdrive, and running the calculations for lightspeed.  It was time to go.

Small ships have a tiny crew, often only a pilot and perhaps an astromech, but often strike above their weight class, a threat to small and large ships alike.

### Starship Improvements
Beginning when your ship reaches 1st tier, it gains the following benefits:

#### Ability Score Improvement
At first tier, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier, you can increase one of your ship's ability scores by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. You can't increase your ability scores other than Dexterity above 20, or your Dexterity above 22, with this feature.

#### Additional Hull and Shield Dice
Your ship gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die. It gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die at 2nd tier (2, each), 3rd tier (3, each), 4th tier (4, each), and 5th tier (5, each).

### Pinpoint Strike
Also at 1st tier, your starship gains the ability to slip underneath the shields of an enemy ship.

When your ship occupies the same square occupied by a target ship and the pilot makes an attack roll, as a reaction, the pilot can, before rolling the attack, roll a Pinpoint Strike die, which is a d4, and add it to the attack roll.  If the attack requires a saving throw instead, you may subtract the Pinpoint Strike die from the target's save result.  On a hit or a failed save, the attack deals normal damage that bypasses any shields and directly hits the hull of the target ship. This feature can only be used by the pilot, and it can only be used once per round.

Your ship's Pinpoint Strike die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

#### Superiority Fighter
Your ship's flying speed increases by 50 feet.


### Retro Thrusters
Also at 2nd tier, when an attacker that a crewmember can see deals damage to your ship with a weapon, they can use their reaction to immediately move the ship up to 50 feet in a direction of their choice, halving the damage your ship takes. The orientation of the ship does not change.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

### Versatile Snubfighter
Starting at 3rd tier, when a crewmember makes, with the ship, an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A crewmember can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.

### Auto-Thrusters

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

### Paragon Snubfighter
As of 5th tier, your starship is the best in its class. Choose any one from the following:

## Medium ShipsThe freighter shudders with the blasts of cannon fire. Despite</span> its maneuvers, the pilot can't quite shake the pursuit. The technician's efforts to reinforce the shields are failing.  The mechanic is pumping the reactor for every scrap of energy it can generate. The operator is frantically making the final few calculations for the jump to hyperspace.  Finally, just as the ship's shields dissipate, the pilot makes the gut call, jettisoning the illicit cargo. As it distracts and hampers the followers, the freighter shifts power to the thrusters and quickly flies away.

As the pirates activate their tractor beam to attempt to capture the weaponless frigate and its exotic wares, the gunboat escort intercedes. It flies in the line of the tractor, breaking the lock on the frigate, and unleashes a volley of cannon fire. The pirates, incapable of with-standing the salvo, drop the tractor beam and retreat.  As the gunboat pursues to be sure the pirates don't come back for a second bite at the apple, the crew finally locks on target and unleashes a long-range night-stinger missile, putting a permanent end to the pirates' illicit and unwelcome activities.




The captain invites his guests into his well-stocked cantina. He eyes the opposition as they take in his ship, assessing their reactions and noting their expressions.  Fully aware of the effect the opulent room has on the unprepared, he easily stifles his grin and gestures for the starry-eyed vis-itors to sit across from him. He indicates for the server to bring drinks as he casually leans back and puts his feet on the table, confident this deal will go his way.  He presses a button on the tiny remote in his hand, causing hidden panels to slide away and reveal his mostly-legal wares.  "So," he says, "just how many of these do you need, and where will I deliver them?"

Medium ships are the bread and butter of the close-knit group. They are large enough to accommodate all of the immediate needs of a crew, while at the same time being small enough to feel cozy.

### Evasive Maneuvers
Also at 1st tier, when a designated pilot rolls for initiative, they can immediately move the ship. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.

The amount the ship moves is determined by rolling an Evasive Maneuvers die, which is a d4, and multiplying it by 50 feet. The ship then gains that many feet that it can move or spend to turn.

Your ship's Evasive Maneuvers die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

## Large ShipsTrapped in the capital ship's tractor beam, the ambassador</span> frigate moves slowly towards the cruiser. The crew struggles to squeeze more power out of their reactor while the few marines on board take positions next to the hatches, wiping sweat from their brows as they check and re-check their weapons. Finally, bringing all the power the ship has to bare, the frigate is able to break the hold of the tractor beam and regain its trajectory, slowly but surely increasing the distance, before finally escaping the planet's moon and being able to jump to hyperspace.  Shouts of joy echo down the ship's corridors and extra rations are ordered in celebration.

Engines burning brightly, the corvette sprints through the blockade, trying to minimize the amount of fire its meager shields will have to absorb.  Top and bottom turrets swivel to port, unleashing return fire against inbound interceptors.  The ground drops from under everyone's feet as the artificial gravity systems flicker for a second as a pulse weapon detonates nearby.  The high-pitched, distant whine of the reactor is barely audible over commands issuing from the bridge.  The visual readouts indicated that they were now past the picket line, and the interceptors appeared to be breaking off, unsure of their ability to take on the much larger ship without the support of their battle stations.  They'd made it.  Looking back at the scopes, the coordinator's head hung down.  They'd been the only ones to do so.


As the Pelta-Class Picket ship danced between the larger destroyers and dreadnaughts, it continued its near constant barrage of heavy laser cannon fire, interspersed with individual launches of concussion missiles and proton torpedoes directed at vulnerable parts of the opposing fleet.  If too many of those enemy guns came to bear on the the Pelta, it would be in trouble, but it's speed and it's relatively limited firepower made it a less-than juicy target.  For now.  But that is exactly what it's captain needed.  Just a few more clicks and they would be in a perfect flanking position, able to pound the engines of the flag ship as soon as it's shields were brought down by the bombing squad beginning their run now.

Large ships occupy the pinnacle of size for most private owner/operators in the galaxy.  Large ships require an extensive crew and are costly to maintain, but can pack quite a punch and may house various suites and operation centers that allow the ship to operate as an impressive and mobile base of operations for wealthy individuals and successful adventurers.

## Huge ShipsThe battleship's shields flicker as it absorbs the blows of the</span>  attacking fighters. It continues inexorably past them as it's point-defense system peppers it's vicinity with blaster fire to ward them off.  As it a approaches the fragile medical frigate the fighters scramble to protect, its gunners lock on to the target before unleashing a fierce volley of turbolaser fire and snapping it in half.   

As the carrier leaves hyperspace, snubfighters deploy from its hangars in formations and move to intercept the space station's patrol fighters. Before the enemy craft have the opportunity to respond, the fighters fall upon them, quickly decimating their ranks. But before the snubfighters had even left the carrier, a second wave of small bombers had been prepping for takeoff.  As they spew forth from the hangars, they quickly lock on to the space station and launch proton bombs, pulverizing the station in minutes.




With the command given, the operator activates the interdictor's gravity well projectors. the lights inside dim almost imperceptibly as huge amounts of power is drawn from the reactor core and supplemental capacitors to the projectors.  Accompanied by a low-pitched hum, the gravity well projectors power up. Minutes pass for the ship uneventfully, until finally a frigate lurches unceremoniously out of hyperspace into realspace in front of them. The ship then activates its tractor beam, trapping its quarry.

Huge starships, regardless of their specific purpose, are the backbone of any military. They provide a mobile base of operations and function as a staging ground for the faction that controls them.

## Gargantuan ShipsThe smaller ships retreat into the shadow of the blockade</span> ship, fleeing an overwhelming foe. As the dread-nought's shields envelope them, they quickly turn and spring on their pursuers, utilizing the bulwark's shields as they unleash all of the firepower they have to bear.  Meanwhile, the blockade ship unleashes a storm of electromagnetic energy from its antenna array, cutting of communications between enemy ships, effectively isolating the incoming forces from their distant fleet and from each other.

In the center of the fleet, the command ship surveys the battlefield. Wherever the line wavers, the command ship quickly directs ships to reinforce. Finally, the formations of the enemy flag, and the command ship directs the fleet to capitalize on their failure as it determines and uploads targeting coordinates to its torpedo ships.




;The warship looms ominously over the battlefield as the two opposing armies crash. Despite the efforts of the enemy line, the warship closes into firing range of the capital ships.  Having already determined an ordered targeting precedence, the operating crew confirms final firing solutions for the gunners as they charge up the main super-weapon on the prow of the ship.  It unleashes its first devastating blast as the rest of its arsenal begins to lance out at secondary targets nearby.

Gargantuan ships are the dreadnoughts that strike fear into the hearts of the faithless. They are the embodiment of indomitable might: a symbol of total and complete control.

On a failed save, affected crewmembers have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make each round for 1 minute. At the end of each of their turns, they repeat this save, ending this effect on a success. Additionally, on a successful save, they become immune to this feature for one day.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.

### Versatile Dreadnought
Starting at 3rd tier, when a crewmember makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A crewmember can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.

### Superweapon
Also at 3rd tier, your ship is equipped with a superweapon. As an action, a crewmember can activate the superweapon, which has a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. When activated, a beam of destructive energy forming a line 10,000 feet long and 100 feet wide blasts from the weapon. Each ship in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + the crewmember's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 15d10 energy damage, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Researcher 
When you use your ship's Superweapon, you can alter its functionality. Instead of dealing damage, ships who fail a saving throw are blinded, ionized, and shocked for 1 minute. Ships who succeed on the saving throw suffer these effects until the start of your ship's next turn, instead.

#### Warship
When a crewmember on your ship rolls the maximum on a damage die for a ship weapon, they can roll an additional die.
