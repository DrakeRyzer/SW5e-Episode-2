# Chapter 5: Equipment

T>he cities of *Star Wars* are diverse and multicultural, varying dramatically by planet and system. Commonplace activities in one city might be taboo in another. The most common species on one planet might be shunned on the next one. Every city, in addition to the climate and cultures, varies dramatically in the options available for sale.
In addition to those options available in the *Player's Handbook*, adventurers might encounter new and interesting wares. On some planets, and in some cultures, armor is made from unique materials that grant it interesting properties. On other planets, a more diverse armory might be available for purchase-or theft. In other places still, interesting and unique adventuring implements might be discovered.

#### Starting Equipment
When choosing the starting equipment for your class, you might have an option to choose any of a certain type of item. For instance, berserkers get a choice of "*(a)* a martial vibroweapon and a light or medium physical shield or *(b)* two martial vibroweapons". When choosing starting equipment in this fashion, the items available in this chapter should not be included. However, if you use instead use the Variant: Starting Wealth by Class rule, the items in this chapter should be considered available for purchase.

#### Ammunition
Blasters that deal energy or ion damage use power cells, while blasters that deal kinetic damage use slug cartridges. This chapter introduces blasters that deal new damage types: acid, fire, and sonic. These weapons also use power cells.

### Buying and Selling Treasure
This chapter introduces armor, weapons, adventuring gear, and other valuable materials. Like those options found in the *Player's Handbook*, selling these items should generally be possible, provided they are unspoiled. 

#### Enhanced Items
Enhanced items are scarce and powerful, leading to them rarely having a predetermined price. Buying and selling enhanced items can rarely be performed easily, often requiring extensive time and credits to find a potential buyer and seller. 

#### Rare Materials
While rare materials, as the name indicates, are more scarce than their raw material counterparts, they typically have a commonly accepted value across markets. While they won't always be available for sale, they will usually fetch the same price across worlds.



## Armor and Shields
Adventuring through the different worlds of *Star Wars* shows limitless variety across cultures, varying drastically by their values and technological availability. Many cultures create similar items, but using different materials, granting their items a unique flair. The Armor table shows some examples of how commonly available types of armor found in the game differ, depending on the materials used.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of these types of armor worn in the worlds of *Star Wars*.

### Armor and Shield Proficiency
Anyone can put on a suit of armor or wield a shield. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't force- or tech-cast.

If you have proficiency in armor, you have proficiency in the appropriate shield as well.

### Armor Class (AC)
Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your Armor Class.

### Armor Materials
In addition to form and function, armor varies greatly based on material. Beyond those standard materials universally available to armor, you might find armor made with more specialized and scarce materials. Armor made with these materials offers a unique strength, but also a weakness. Additionally, the armor's cost increases by an amount, based on the armor's type, as shown in the Armor Type Cost Increase table below:

##### Armor Type Cost Increase



|Armor<br> Type|Cost<br> Increase|
|:--|--:|
|Light armor|1,000 cr|
|Medium armor|2,000 cr|
|Heavy armor|6,000 cr|

|Armor<br> Type|Cost<br> Increase|
|:--|--:|
|Light shield|250 cr|
|Medium shield|750 cr|
|Heavy shield|1,500 cr|

Only physical shields can be crafted using alternative armor materials. Additionally, barding can be created using alternative armor materials.

#### Multiple Materials
Armor and shields can be made using an amalgam of materials. Doing so increases the cost of the armor or shield for each material used in its creation, and the number of materials used can't exceed half the crafter's proficiency bonus, rounded up.







#### Beskar
Armor and shields made from beskar gains the regulated property, but also the strength 11 property. If the armor or shield would already have the strength property, instead increase the strength number by 2.

Bone armor and shields have the barbed (1d4) and spiked (1d4) properties, respectively, but suffer a -1 penalty to Armor Class.

#### Crystadium
Armor and shields made from crystadium has the absorptive 1 property, but also the rigid and imbalanced properties, respectively.

#### Durafiber
Durafiber armor and shields have their strength number reduced by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If the strength number is 11, this removes the strength property from it entirely. If the armor or shield lacks the strength property, it instead gains the lightweight property. Additionally, durafiber armor and shields suffer a -1 penalty to Armor Class. 

#### Duranium
Armor and shields made from duranium gain the reactive 1 and responsive 1 properties, respectively, but also the cumbersome property.

#### Durasteel
Durasteel armor has the impermeable 2 and rigid properties. Durasteel shields have the interlocking and imbalanced properties.

#### Duravlex 
Armor and shields made from duravlex have the silent and concealing properties, respectively, but suffer a -1 penalty to Armor Class.

#### Fleximetal
Fleximetal armor and shields gain the avoidant 1 property, but also the strength 11 property. If the armor or shield would already have the strength property, instead increase the strength number by 2.

#### Laminanium
Armor and shields made from laminanium gain the obscured and lambent properties, respectively, but also the cumbersome property.

#### Neutronium
Neutronium armor and shields gain the insulated 1 property, but also the strength 11 property. If the armor or shield would already have the strength property, instead increase the strength number by 2.

#### Plastoid
Armor made from plastoid has the reinforced and rigid properties. Shields made from plastoid have the anchor and imbalanced properties.

#### Quadanium
Quadanium armor and shields gain the charging 1 property, but also the cumbersome property.

#### Interlocking
While wielding a shield with this property within 5 feet of a friendly creature who is also wielding a shield with this property, you can both use your reactions on either of your turns to interlock the shields. While interlocked, both creatures gain a bonus to AC equal to the interlocking number. If at any point the creatures are more than 5 feet from each other, the shields immediately de-interlock, and this effect ends.

#### Lambent
While wielding a shield with this property, you can use a bonus action to activate or deactivate the shield's light. While active, the shield sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the shield's light is active that rely on sight have disadvantage.

#### Lightweight
Armor and shields with this property have their weight reduced by half.

#### Magnetic

## Weapons
In addition to armor varying across myriad planets, you might find new and unique types of weaponry available. Your weapon proficiencies reflect the tools you are most likely to use. The Weapons tables show additional weapons used in the worlds of *Star Wars*, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. 

### Weapon Proficiency
Your species, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The three types of weapons-blaster, lightweapon, and vibroweapon, are further broken down into two categories-simple and martial. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

Proficiency in these weapons is discussed further in Chapter 6.





### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

#### Biting
This weapon's damage becomes acid. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack with a weapon with the biting property, you can instead force the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon, or the biting number, whichever is lower). If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit, and the first attack it makes before the end of its next turn has disadvantage. If damage dealt by this weapon reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.





#### Bright
This weapon's damage becomes fire, and its luminous property sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet while activated, instead of only dim light in a 5-foot radius. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack with a weapon with the bright property, you can instead force the target to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon, or the bright number, whichever is lower). If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit, and the creature takes additional damage of the same type at the start of its next turn equal to your governing ability modifier.

#### Brutal
When you score a critical hit with a weapon with the brutal property, you roll a number of additional weapon damage dice equal to the brutal number.

#### Corruption
This weapon's damage becomes necrotic, and it loses the luminous property if it has it. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack with a weapon with the corruption property, you can instead force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon, or the corruption number, whichever is lower). If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit, and the creature cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

#### Defensive
When you make your first attack on your turn with a weapon with the defensive property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to attack and damage rolls with that weapon up to the defensive number. If you do so, you gain the same bonus to AC. These effects last until the start of your next turn, as long as you're holding the weapon.

#### Dire
Before you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the dire property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to the attack roll up to the dire number. If you do so and you hit with it, you gain an equivalent bonus to the damage roll.

#### Disarming
When you score a critical hit with a weapon with the disarming property against a creature that is holding an object, you can attempt to disarm the target (no action required). If the target is no more than one size larger than you (your size or smaller if your weapon has the light property), it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or it drops an object of your choice at its feet.



#### Disintegrate
When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a weapon with the disintegrate property, it must make a Constitution saving throw, DC equal to the disintegrate number. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing or carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.

#### Disruptive
When a creature is forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration due to taking damage from a weapon with the disruptive property, the DC for the check equals 10 or the full damage taken, whichever number is higher, instead of only half.

#### Keen
When you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the keen property, the critical hit range increases by an amount equal to the keen number.

#### Mighty
When making an attack with a mighty weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Neuralizing
When you hit a creature with a weapon with the neuralizing property, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, DC equal to the neuralizing number. On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you until the start of its next turn.

#### Piercing
Before you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the piercing property, you can choose to gain a bonus to the attack roll up to the piercing number. If you do so and you hit with it, you suffer an equivalent penalty to the damage roll.

#### Reckless
When you make your first attack on your turn with a weapon with the reckless property, you can choose to gain a penalty to AC up to the reckless number. If you do so, you gain the same bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon. These effects last until the start of your next turn, as long as you're holding the weapon.

#### Shocking
When you hit a creature with a weapon with the shocking property, you can force it to make a Dexterity saving throw, DC equal to the shocking number. On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 1d4 lightning damage and becomes shocked until the end of its next turn.

#### Silent
When you make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with the silent property while hidden, it does not automatically reveal your presence. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by your targets' Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you remain hidden.







#### Smart
This weapon ignores your Dexterity score and proficiency bonus. Two numbers appear in parentheses with the property-the first is the weapon's Dexterity score, and the second is the weapon's proficiency bonus. The weapon uses these values instead of yours when you make attack and damage rolls with it. If you lack proficiency with the weapon, the weapon does not benefit from its proficiency bonus.

#### Sonorous
When you hit a creature with a weapon with the sonorous property, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw, DC equal to the sonorous number. On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 1d4 sonic damage and becomes deafened until the end of its next turn.

#### Switch
A weapon with the switch property can deal an alternate type of damage. A damage value appears in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon uses its alternate damage type. On your turn, you can use your object interaction to change the weapon's damage type.

#### Vicious
Whenever you deal damage with a weapon with the vicious property and roll the maximum on a weapon damage die, you gain a bonus to damage equal to the vicious number.



### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described below.

#### Flechette Cannon
The flechette cannon does not make attack rolls. Rather than traditional power cells, the flechette cannon uses specialized projector tanks, which, when fired, spray an area with the contents of the tank. Projector tanks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tankís effects. It can have different ammunition types loaded simultaneously, and you can choose which ammunition youíre using as you fire it (no action required). If you donít meet the flechette cannonís strength requirement, creatures have advantage on their saving throws. If you lack proficiency in the flechette cannon, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

#### Grenade Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the grenade launcher fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, or if you donít meet the grenade launcherís strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the grenadeís explosion have advantage on the saving throw. If you lack proficiency in the grenade launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

#### Rocket Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the rocket launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of rockets. When firing a rocket at long range, or if you donít meet the rocket launcherís strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the rocketís explosion have advantage on the saving throw.

#### Shoulder Blaster
Mounted by the shoulder slot, a shoulder blaster does not require a free hand to use. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of this weapon.

#### Shoulder Cannon
Mounted by the shoulder slot, a shoulder cannon does not require a free hand to use. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of this weapon.

#### Vapor Projector
The vapor projector does not make attack rolls. Rather than traditional power cells, the vapor projector uses specialized projector tanks, which, when fired, spray an area with the contents of the tank. 

Projector tanks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tankís effects. It can have different ammunition types loaded simultaneously, and you can choose which ammunition youíre using as you fire it (no action required). If you donít meet the vapor projectorís strength requirement, creatures have advantage on their saving throws. If you lack proficiency in the vapor projector, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

## Focuses


For both force- and tech-casting, there exist focuses which are used to channel their respective powers. While focus generators are optional for forcecasters, techcasters are required to have a focus in order to cast their powers. Wristpads are traditionally worn on the wrist and do not require a hand to activate, while focus generators generally take the form of a small scepter or crystal that is traditionally held in the hand.

### Focus Proficiency
Unlike weapons and armor, no proficiency is required to use focuses. Instead, you need the ability to forcecast for focus generators and the ability to techcast for wristpads.

> #### Variant: Alternative Focuses
> While traditionally there are only two types of focuses-focus generators and wristpads-certain class features and enhanced items unlock the ability to use an alternative item type. If a character wants to use something else as their focus, such as a lightsaber or a heavy shield, consider allowing them to do so. Later in this chapter, you'll find rules to add casting properties to unenhanced focuses. As GM, you can consider extending these rules to weapons and armor, or even tools for your engineer, as you deem appropriate.
>
> Additionally, there are a significant number of focus generator and wristpad modifications that grant these properties. If a player wants to use an alternative focus, consider allowing them to use focus generator and wristpad modifications to in place of the normal modifications for the item they're using as a focus. If they do so, the DC to install or remove a modification, as shown on page \_\_\_, is increased by 5. You should also consider allowing engineers to install these mods in their archetype focus, even if there is no existing chassis for that item.



### Casting Properties
Some focuses have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Data Recording and Storage subsection of the Adventuring Gear section.

#### Absorbing
While using this item as your focus, when you take damage from any source, you can reduce that damage by an amount up to the absorptive number, provided you have a number of force or tech points equal to half the damage absorbed. When you do so, you lose half the damage taken in force or tech points.

#### Accessing
While using this item as your focus, you gain access to a number of new powers (chosen by the GM) of a combined total no greater than the access number. The powers count as known by you, and you can't unlearn the powers.

#### Amplifying
While using this item as your focus, your critical hit range with melee force or tech attacks increases by an amount equal to the amplifying number.

#### Bolstering 
_**Prerequisite:** Focus generator property_<br>
While using this item as your focus, your maximum force points increase by the bolstering number.

#### Constitution
While using an item with this property as your focus, you gain no benefit from any additional properties the item has unless your Constitution score meets or exceeds the constitution number.

#### Dispelling
While using this item as your focus, your level of proficiency in force- or tech-casting ability checks increases by a number of steps equal to the dispelling number (to trained, from trained to proficient, from proficient to expertise, from expertise to mastery, from mastery to high mastery, or from high mastery to grand mastery).





#### Elongating 
While using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that affects a cylinder, the height of the cylinder increases by an amount equal to the elongating number, and the radius of the cylinder increases by an amount equal to half the elongating number.

#### Enlarging
While using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that affects a cube, the length of each side of the cube increases by an amount equal to the enlarging number.

#### Expanding
While using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that affects a cone, the length of that cone increases by an amount equal to the expanding number.

#### Extending 
While using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that affects a line, the length of the line increases by an amount equal to the extending number, and the width of the line increases by an amount equal to half the extending number.

#### Fading
While using this item as your focus, the critical fail range of force or tech powers that require a Strength or Constitution saving throw increases by an amount equal to the fading number.

#### Focused
While using this item as your focus, you can't have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration.

#### Increasing
While using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that has a range of 5 feet or greater, the range of that power increases by an amount equal to the increasing number.

> #### Adding Casting Properties to Focuses
> Each of these properties can be used to create a new unenhanced focus generator wristpad. When generating new focuses for player character use, each positive property should be offset by a level of Constitution, and each property should increase the of the focus by 1,000 cr. This cost scales by the number of properties and it is in addition to the base cost of the time. For instance, a wristpad with one positive property and the Constitution 11 property would cost 1,600 cr (1,000 cr for the positive property + 600 for the base cost of the wristpad). A wristpad with two positive properties and the Constitution 13 property, however, would cost 3,600 cr (1,000 cr for the first property, 2,000 cr for the second property, and 600 for the base cost of the wristpad). GMs can generate new focuses in this way, similar to how the Weapon Calculator can be used to generate new weapons at the discretion of the GM. Unenhanced focuses can't exceed 1 level in a single property.



#### Inflating 
While using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that affects a sphere, the radius of the sphere increases by an amount equal to the inflating number.

#### Mitigating 
While using this item as your focus, using the Ready action to cast a force or tech power no longer requires concentration. You can only have one instance of this feature active at a time. Additionally, if the power would not be released, and the power was 1st level or higher, the cost of the power is reduced by a number of points equal to the mitigating number, to a minimum of 1.

#### Ranging
While using this item as your focus, your critical hit range with ranged force or tech attacks increases by an amount equal to the ranging number.

#### Rending
While using this item as your focus, the critical fail range of force or tech powers that require a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw increases by an amount equal to the rending number.

#### Repelling
While using this item as your focus, your powers are no longer automatically dispelled or interrupted. Instead, the DC to interrupt or dispel your powers is equal to 10 + the power's level, or 8 + half your proficiency bonus + your casting modifier for that power, whichever is greater.

#### Storing
While using this item as your focus, you can store 1st-level or higher powers of a combined total no greater than the storing number within the focus for later use. You can cast a power into this item while touching it. The power has no effect other than to be stored in the item. If the item can't hold the power, the power is expended without effect. You can cast any power stored in it at its base level, causing the power to no longer be stored, freeing up the space.

#### Surging 
_**Prerequisite:** Wristpad property_<br>
While using this item as your focus, your maximum tech points increase by the surging number.

#### Withering
While using this item as your focus, the critical fail range of force or tech powers that require a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw increases by an amount equal to the withering number.

> #### Variant: Focus Properties and<br> &emsp;Features
> Many of these properties could affect class features. Consider extending those properties to benefit those features, as appropriate.

#### Corrosive Cartridge
A corrosive cartridge is a specialized slug cartridge for use with blaster weapons that deal kinetic damage. When you hit with a shot with the loaded weapon, the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d8 acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with the loaded weapon, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing or carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized. 

#### Cryo Cell
A cryo cell is a specialized power cell for use with blaster weapons that deal acid, energy, fire, ion, or sonic damage. The loaded weapon deals cold damage instead of its normal damage type, and when you hit with a shot the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't slowed. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is frozen in carbonite for 1 hour.

#### Deafening Calibrator
As an action, you can apply this calibrator to one vibroweapon or pair of handwraps within 5 feet, granting it a +1 bonus to damage rolls for 1 minute. This bonus is in addition to any bonuses granted by the weapon. Additionally, for the duration, the weapon gains the sonorous 13 property. If it already has the sonorous property, its sonorous number increases by 1, to a maximum of 18.

#### Deafening Cell
A deafening cell is a specialized power cell for use with blaster weapons that deal acid, energy, fire, ion, or sonic damage. The loaded weapon deals sonic damage instead of its normal damage type, and when you hit with a shot the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 sonic damage and is deafened until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't deafened. 

#### Deafening Collimator
As an action, you can apply this collimator to one lightweapon within 5 feet, granting it a +1 bonus to damage rolls for 1 minute. This bonus is in addition to any bonuses granted by the weapon. Additionally, for the duration, the weapon gains the sonorous 13 property. If it already has the sonorous property, its sonorous number increases by 1, to a maximum of 18.



#### Deafening Dart
This wrist launcher ammunition deals 1d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Also on a hit, the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 1d4 sonic damage on a failed save. 

Additionally, on a failed save, a creature is deafened for 1 minute. At the end of an affected creature's turn, it can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.

#### Electrifying Calibrator
As an action, you can apply this calibrator to one vibroweapon or pair of handwraps within 5 feet, granting it a +1 bonus to damage rolls for 1 minute. This bonus is in addition to any bonuses granted by the weapon. Additionally, for the duration, the weapon gains the shocking 13 property. If it already has the shocking property, its shocking number increases by 1, to a maximum of 18.

#### Electrifying Cartridge
An electrifying cartridge is a specialized slug cartridge for use with blaster weapons that deal kinetic damage. When you hit with a shot with the loaded weapon, the creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 lightning damage and becomes shocked until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't shocked.

#### Electrifying Collimator
As an action, you can apply this collimator to one lightweapon within 5 feet, granting it a +1 bonus to damage rolls for 1 minute. This bonus is in addition to any bonuses granted by the weapon. Additionally, for the duration, the weapon gains the shocking 13 property. If it already has the shocking property, its shocking number increases by 1, to a maximum of 18.

#### Electrifying Dart

|	&emsp;Smugglepack     	|	   400 cr	|	  6.00 lb		|

#### Camtono
A camtono is a secured, handle container used for transporting valuable goods. A camtono comes with one key. Without the key, unlocking the camtono requires a DC 15 security kit to force open. It stores 5 lb., not exceeding 1/4 cubic foot, has an AC of 10, and 15 hit points. Destroying the camtono risks damaging any goods stored inside.

#### Smugglepack
This backpack comes with a main compartment that stores 15.00 lb., not exceeding 1/2 cubic foot. Additionally, it has a hidden storage compartment that stores 5 lb., not exceeding 1/4 cubic foot. Finding the hidden compartment requires a DC 15 Investigation check.

|	&emsp;Security spike     	|	 150 cr	|	.50 lb		|

#### Computer Spike
When you make an Intelligence (slicer's kit) check, you can use the spike (no action required) to reroll the check. You must use the new roll. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use the spike, but you must decide before the GM says whether the check succeeds or fails.

#### Security Spike

|	&emsp;Ammo-feed belt            |    450 cr	    |	1.00 lb		|
|	&emsp;Holster                   |     75 cr	    |	2.00 lb		|
|	&emsp;Power belt                |    400 cr	    |	1.00 lb		|
|	&emsp;Rocketpack	            | 10,000 cr	|	35.00 lb		|

#### Ammo-feed Belt
This belt has slots to hold 60 slug cartridges, and can be connected to directly fuel a single blaster weapon that uses slug cartridges. Once per turn, if the powered weapon would be reloaded, it can be done without using an action using any ammunition in the belt. Connecting or disconnecting a weapon takes an action. Replacing 10 slug cartridges takes an action.


#### Holster
A holster can be worn on the leg, hip, or back, and can be used to store a single weapon. You can draw a weapon stored in a holster without using an action. Once you've done so, you can't do so again until you store a weapon in the holster as an action.

#### Power Belt
This belt has slots to hold six power cells, and can be connected to directly power a single blaster weapon that uses power cells. Once per turn, if the powered weapon would be reloaded, it can be done without using an action using any ammunition in the belt. Connecting or disconnecting a weapon takes an action. Replacing an expended power cell takes an action.

#### Rocketpack
Rocketpacks combine the aerial transportation of a jetpack with the firepower of a rocket launcher. Activating or deactivating the rocketpack's flight capabilities requires a bonus action and, while active, you have a flying speed of 25 feet. The jetpack last for 1 minute per power cell (to a maximum of 5 minutes) and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cells.

Additionally, your rocketpack comes with an integrated rocket launcher with the Ammunition (range 100/400) and reload 1 properties. Rather than traditional power cells, this rocket launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of rockets. Whenever you would make a ranged weapon attack, you can instead fire this rocket launcher. When firing a rocket at long range, creatures within the radius of the rocket's explosion have advantage on the saving throw. Reloading this rocket launcher takes 1 minute.

## Tools
A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, pick a lock, or slice into a computer. Your species, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. Like skills, proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it. Unlike skills, you must have your tools present in order to make an ability check with them. 

The table shows examples of some of the most common types of tools. Each tool falls under one of four categories: artisan's implements, gaming sets, musical instruments, or specialist's kits. Each tool requires a separate proficiency. 

#### Artisan's Implements
Artisan's implements are predominantly designed for building and crafting things of permanent nature. Each set of implements focuses on a specific craft. 

***Artist's Implements.*** Artist's implements encompasses any set of tools designed to create art.

***Audiotech's Implements.*** Audiotech's implements are for crafting and tuning musical instruments.

***Constructor's Implements.*** Constructor's implements are for creating and fortifying structures.

***Cybertech's Implements.*** Cybertech's implements are used for crafting and modifying wristpads.

***Geneticist's Implements.*** Geneticist's implements are for creating and grafting genetic mutations.

***Jeweler's Implements.*** Jeweler's implements are used to appraise gemstones and create jewelry.

***Surveyor's Implements.*** Surveyor's implements are used to create both physical and digital maps.

***Synthweaver's Implements.*** Synthweaver's implements create and modify articles of clothing.

***Writer's Implements.*** Writer's implements contains everything needed to create and publish physical and digital written works. 

#### Gaming Sets
This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and/or decks of cards. A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. 

#### Musical Instruments
Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. Musical instruments can often be used in place of-or in addition to-a performance.

#### Specialist's Kits
Like artisan's implements, specialist's kits are need to pursue a craft or trade. Some specialist's kits are used to craft items that are impermanent, such as grenades, medpacs, or poisons while other tools are used to achieve a specific purpose, such as picking locks or creating a disguise.

***Alchemist's Kit.*** Alchemist's kits contains everything needed to enhance creatures and items with alchemy.

***Archaeologist Kit.*** Archelogist kits contains instruments used to collect gems and relics. 


***Artillerist's Kit.*** Artillerist's kits contains all the necessary tools to create, repair, and modify turrets. 

***Bioanalysis Kit.*** Bioanalysis kits contains a variety of instruments to harvest and store plants and herbs. 

***Brewer's Kit.*** Brewer's kits contains a variety of devices and containers to adequately distill and house liquors and beers. 

***Munitions Kit.*** Munitions kits contains the necessary tools to create ammunition for blasters, as well as devices to hone lightweapons and vibroweapons.

***Scavenging Kit.*** Scavenging kits contains the necessary implements to harvest and scavenge ores and metals. 

***Spicer's Kit.*** Spicer's kits contains the required tools to create and refine illicit substances.

## Trade Goods
Trade is an essential part of the galactic economy. Many spacers make their living buying and selling goods along hyperspace routes that connect the galaxy's major worlds.

A merchant may be chartered by an individual or a corporation to deliver goods to a certain port, or move goods along a specified route. During times of war, opportunities abound in the shipping of ammunition and medical supplies. Some traders, seeking to earn a quick profit, may resort to smuggling illegal or restricted cargo on behalf of one of the galaxy's many crime syndicates. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.

## Substances
Substances, most commonly coming in the alcohol and spice varieties, are goods often sought after by the more seedy denizens of the *Star Wars* underworld. Whether legal or not, people search for these wares, whether to consume or profit on.

### Consumption
Consuming substances offers powerful temporary boons in the form of a high, potentially offset by a subsequent low. Additionally, consuming substances regularly risks addiction, which reduces the efficacy of substances until a creature abstains from using them.

#### Highs and Lows
Each substance offers a high followed immediately by a potential low. For the duration of the high, a creature might gain a bonus to an ability score, temporary force or tech points, or some other boon. Immediately when the high ends, the character must succeed on a saving throw depending on the substance or suffer a longer-lasting low, which reverses the effects. The high and low varies depending on the substance consumed, and the duration of the high and low vary based on the rarity of the substance consumed, as determined in the item's description.

A creature can only benefit from one substance at a time. If a creature consumes an additional unit of a substance, while currently experiencing a high or a low, they must immediately make a saving throw to resist the effects of addiction before applying the benefits of the consumed substance. Consuming a substance while experiencing a low immediately ends the low, but any time remaining in that low is added to the duration of the low of the additional consumed substance.

#### Addiction
Consuming substances regularly also risks becoming addicted to a substance. When the low of a substance ends, a creature must make a saving throw, determined by what substance they are coming off of, as determined in the substance's description. Addiction is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of addiction, as specified in the effect's description.

##### Addiction Level
|Level|Effect|
|:--:|:--|
|1|The duration of lows is doubled.|
|2|The duration of highs is halved.|
|3|The duration of lows is quadrupled, instead of doubled.|
|4|The effect of highs is halved.|
|5|The effect of lows is maximized.|
|6|The effect of highs is minimized.|

If an already addicted creature suffers another effect that causes addiction, its current level of addiction increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of addiction as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 addiction has the duration of its lows doubled, and the duration of its highs halved.

An effect that removes addiction reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all addiction effects ending if a creature's addiction level is reduced below 1.

If a creature abstains from consuming a substance for 24 hours, they can make a Wisdom saving throw to reduce their addiction level by 1, provided they've completed a long rest during that 24 hours. The DC for the saving throw equals 10 + the creature's addiction level. On a success, their addiction level is reduced by 1. For instance, a creature suffering addiction level 3 can abstain from consuming any substance for 24 hours. If they do so, and they complete a long rest during that 24 hour period, they can make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, their addiction level is reduced to 2.
