# Chapter 6: Customization Options

T>he combination of ability scores, species, class, and; background defines your character's capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players whoówith the GM's permissionówant to go a step further.
This chapter expands on feats, which are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.

### Fighting Styles and Masteries
Wretched Hives introduces new ammunition types, such as the specialized power cells, or rockets. You'll want to extend the benefits of certain Fighting Styles and Fighting Masteries to these new munitions, as explained below.

#### Explosives Style and Mastery
You will want to extend the benefits of this pair to include rockets.

#### Area Style and Mastery
You will want to extend the benefits of this pair to include flechette clips, flechette mags, and projector tanks.

#### Gunning Style and Mastery
You'll want to extend the benefits of this pair to include specialized power cells and slug cartridges.

### Class Proficiencies
Certain classes, such as fighters or guardians, gain proficiency in all weapons within a specific category. For instance, fighters gain proficiency in all blasters and vibroweapons, and guardians gain proficiency in all lightweapons and vibroweapons. Monk, operative, scholar, and sentinel, on the other hand, only gain proficiency in martial weapons that meet certain criteria. If that criteria is met due to the use of an item or feature that addóor removeóa referenced property, this does not grant that class proficiency in the weapon. For instance, operatives gain proficiency in simple blasters, simple vibroweapons, martial blasters that lack the auto, special, strength, and two-handed properties, martial vibroweapons with the finesse property. If they add the finesse property to a vibroweapon, or remove the strength property from a blaster weapon, this would not grant the operative proficiency in that weapon.



## Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehowóperhaps by a withering curseóyou can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.
