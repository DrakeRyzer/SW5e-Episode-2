# Chapter 1: Step-By-Step Factions

Many factions span the galaxy, from lowly gangs inhabiting a single city to governments controlling the majority of known planets. While many characters will find a faction they want to joinófor instance, a Jedi will most likely want to climb the ranks of the Jedi Orderómany characters will prefer to build their own.
Before you dive into step 1 below, thinking about whether or not establishing your own faction is the correct route, and what your faction will do that is not already done better by others. You might want to create your own bounty hunter organization and try to take on the greatest bounties the galaxy has to offer. Maybe you want to start your own government and break away from the known powers. Perhaps you want to start your own faction of Force-wielders, separate from the Jedi and the Sith. Or maybe you just want to create your own chain of casino resorts, with pazaak and companions.

Once you have a faction in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the faction you want. Your conception of your faction might evolve with each choice you make. What's important is that your faction helps you realize a character you're excited to play.

Throughout this section, we use the term **faction sheet** to mean whatever you use to track your faction, whether it's a formal sheet (like the ones at the end of these rules), some sort of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. The official SW5e sheets are a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.

> ##### Building the Mandalorians
> Each step of faction creation includes an example of that step, with a player building the iconic faction the Mandalorians.



### 1. Determine your Ideals
Every faction deviates in what they value, how they exercise those values, and what kind of members they attract. Your faction's ideals help determine what kind of members you'll attract, should you decide to recruit outside the confines of your party.

#### Goals
Each faction has its own goals. One of the most common goals many factions share is the desire for increased wealth and influence. Many factions, however, have goals unique to their own efforts. For instance, a faction might have a goal of maintaining peace and prosperity in their region, directing all of their wealth and influence towards that one goal.

#### Beliefs
Each faction also has its own beliefs. Many nefarious factions, such as the Exchange, believe power should be wielded by the strong, and that the weak deserve to be enslaved, while a more monetarily motivated faction, such as the Commerce Guild, believe that material wealth is the greatest source of control.

#### Member Traits
Members of a faction are often drawn to it because they share common traits with its members. For instance, criminals who prefer to work alone, or in small groups, might be drawn to the Black Sun, while bounty hunters might choose to join the Bounty Broker's Association to earn greater wealth and prestige.

#### Insignia
Every faction has a symbol that represents it, whether that symbol is worn publicly or only shown in secret.

> ##### Building the Mandalorians, Step 1
> Mandalorian culture places heavy emphasis on strength and worthiness. The primary **goal** of the Mandalorians is to prove that their strength is greater than that of others. Mandalorian **beliefs** are characterized by the *Resol'nare*, or the Six Actions:
> - A Mandalorian must wear armor. 
> - A Mandalorian must speak Mando'a. 
> - A Mandalorian must defend themself and their family. 
> - A Mandalorian must contribute to the overall well-being of the clan. 
> - A Mandalorian must raise their children as Mandalorians. 
> - A Mandalorian must heed Mandalore's call and rally to their cause.<br>
>
> Mandalorians often share **member traits** of being strong, hardy, resilient, and uncompromising. The Mandalorian **insignia**óthe *Kyr'bes*ófeatures the skull of a mythosaur. It is a badge of honor that Mandalorians wear openly.

### 2. Establish a Headquarters
Most factions have use of a headquarters. For smaller factions, it might be a simple building, or even a room. For larger factions, however, it might be a space ship, a space station, or even an entire moon or planet. A faction headquarters is required to recruit members to a faction.

What type of headquarters you choose for your faction makes a statement about how effective your faction is in whatever field it operates. Choosing the appropriate location and appearance for your faction's headquarters can help or hinder your ability to recruit new members.

#### Operating Costs
Beyond the required costs for actually maintaining a headquarters, factions have costs directly associated with their functions. These fees might cover licensing fees, bribes, government contracts, etc. These fees amount to roughly 1,000 cr per headquarters per month.

> ##### Building the Mandalorians, Step 2
> The Mandalorians have myriad headquarters throughout the galaxy, including a massive flagship the *Spirit of Vengeance.*



### 3. Determine Ability Scores
Much of what your faction doesóand how it directly affects its membersódepend on its six abilities: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma**. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your faction sheet. The six abilities and their use in the game are described in the **Using Ability Scores** chapter. 

You generate your faction's six **ability scores** using a standard array: 16, 14, 14, 12, 10, 8. You then take these six numbers and write each number beside one of your faction's abilities to assign score to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. 

After assigning your ability scores, determine your faction's **ability modifiers** using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

> ##### Building the Mandalorians, Step 3
> Mandalorians value strength above all, so we assign the highest score, 16, in Strength. The next highest scoresóboth 14ówe apply to Constitution and Wisdom, since Mandalorians are both resilient and perceptive. We then apply the final three scoresó12, 10, and 8óto Charisma, Dexterity, and Intelligence, respectively. The Mandalorian ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 14 (+2), Charisma 12 (+1).

##### Ability Scores and Modifiers

|Score|Modifier|
|:--:|:--:|
|1|-5|
|2-3|-4|
|4-5|-3|
|6-7|-2|
|8-9|-1|
|10-11|+0|
|12-13|+1|
|14-15|+2|
|16-17|+3|
|18-19|+4|
|20-21|+5|
|22-23|+6|
|24-25|+7|
|26-27|+8|
|28-29|+9|
|30|+10|

### 4. Recruitment
In order for a faction to grow, it must recruit members. A smaller faction will have trouble recruiting skilled members, while larger factions don't. 

#### Requirements
Factors, such as a faction's ideals, headquarters, and ability scores play a huge part into how many people a faction can recruit, and how skilled those individuals are. Additionally, many higher skilled potential members of a faction will not consider joining until the faction reaches a high enough tier.

#### Dues
Every faction comes with some requirements that must be fulfilled for members to maintain their status in the faction. For some, it might be simple credit dues. For others, they might require a certain amount of work each month. Consider what your faction's dues should be carefully.

#### Membership Ranks
Factions have five total ranks. New members start at 1st rank, and over time can work their way as high as 5th rank. Each rank unlocks unique benefits on its own, in addition to the normal benefits of faction membership. 

> ##### Building the Mandalorians, Step 4
> Mandalorians are a large, galaxy-spanning faction, that doesn't rely on active recruitment. Instead, new members tend to seek out Mandalorian clans to join. Mandalorians require new members to proficient in at least one martial weapon and require at least one workweek of work a month to retain status.

### 5. Come Together
Factions are a great way to tie a party together in a way that an adventure sometimes can't. To some parties, the founding and expanding of a faction can be an adventure in itself.

#### Beyond 1st Tier
As your faction expands and earns renown, it increases in tier. Each tier unlocks new features, or expands on old ones.

#### Faction Features
When your faction increases in tier, it offers features that benefit members, as shown in the **Factions and Membership** chapter. Some of these features allow you to increase your faction's ability scores. You can't increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every faction's proficiency bonus increases at certain tiers.

Some features only apply to members who have achieved a certain rank. For instance, a 5th-tier faction has access to a cache of premium enhanced items, but only members of 2nd rank or higher are able to requisition from that cache.

#### Renown 
Renown is the primary source of faction and membership progression. Characters earn renown when they work on behalf of their faction, benefiting both themselves and the faction itself. 

> ##### Building the Mandalorians, Step 5
> Mandalorians are a tier 17 faction, having existed for thousands of years, unlocking numerous features over time.
