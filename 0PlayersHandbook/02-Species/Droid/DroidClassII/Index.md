### Appearance
Class II droids are typically small, standing between two and four feet. Their form and color scheme vary based on tasks for which they are created, their affiliation, or quirks of their owner. They are noteworthy for their distinct, function-oriented form.

### Utility
Class II droids are programmed for engineering and other technical sciences. They differ from class one droids because they apply the science to real-life situations. Class II droids are rarely equipped with Basic vocabulators, instead communicating through Binary. There are five subcategories of class II droids. Astromech, exploration, environmental, engineering, and maintenance droids are all class II droids.

### Names
Droids are typically called by their designation, given to them when they are created, or some affectation given to them by their owner. Often this affectation is a play on their designation. Occasionally, noteworthy droids will earn monikers based on their accomplishments.

**Designations (Names).** BB-5 (Beebees), CH-33P (Cheep),  OC-JK14 (Seejay), PT-7 (Poot), RG-G1 (G-G)
