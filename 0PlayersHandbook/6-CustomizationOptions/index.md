# Customization Options

<!--- This paragraph may need to be reworded, as there are options in this channel that shouldn't by restricted by a GM --->

The combination of ability scores, species, class, and background defines your character’s capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do.  But this chapter is for players who-with the GM’s permission-want to go a step further.

This section defines various optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. 

***Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.***

Additionally, this chapter covers three other customization options: fighting styles, fighting masteries, and lightsaber forms. All three options enable a new way to engage with weapons. Lightsaber forms are restricted to forcecasters.

## Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in consular and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

> #### Multiclassing Example
> 
> Drew is playing a 4th-level fighter. When his character earns enough experience points to reach 5th level, Drew decides that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to progress as a fighter. Drew's fighter has been spending a lot of time with Rickey's scout, and has even been doing some jobs on the side for the Bounty Broker's Association as a bounty hunter. Drew decides that his character will multiclass into the operative class, and thus his character becomes a 4th-level fighter and 1st-level operative (written as fighter 4/operative 1).
> 
> When Drew's character earns enough experience to reach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another fighter level (becoming a fighter 5/operative 1), another operative level (becoming a fighter 4/operative 2), or a level in a third class, perhaps dabbling in the Force thanks to a Sith holocron he acquired (becoming a fighter 4/operative 1/consular 1).

### Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a berserker who decides to multiclass into the engineer class must have both Strength and Intelligence scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

##### Multiclassing Prerequisites
|Class|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Ability Score Minimum|
|:--|:--:|:--|
|Berserker||Strength 13|
|Consular||Wisdom or Charisma 13|
|Engineer||Intelligence 13|
|Fighter||Strength or Dexterity 13|
|Guardian||Constitution 13, Wisdom or Charisma 13|
|Monk||Dexterity 13, Wisdom or Charisma 13|
|Operative||Dexterity 13|
|Scholar||Intelligence 13|
|Scout||Strength or Dexterity 13, Intelligence 13|
|Sentinel||Dexterity 13, Wisdom or Charisma 13|

### Experience Points
The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a consular 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a consular.

### Hit Points and Hit Dice
You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the guardian have a d10, so if you are a fighter 5/guardian 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a fighter 5/operative 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1. For example, if you are a fighter 3/operative 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

If a feature or feat allows you to forgo your proficiency bonus, you may only do so once.

### Proficiencies
When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

##### Multiclassing Proficiencies
|Class|&nbsp;&nbsp;|Proficiencies Gained|
|:--|:--:|:--|
|Berserker||Light armor, all vibroweapons||
|Consular||Simple lightweapons|
|Fighter||Light armor, medium armor, all blasters, all vibroweapons|
|Engineer||Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, one tool from the class's list|
|Guardian||Light armor, medium armor, all lightweapons, all vibroweapons|
|Operative||Light armor, any one skill, one tool from the class's list|
|Monk||Techblades|
|Scout||Light armor, medium armor, all blasters, all vibroweapons, one skill from the class's list|
|Scholar||Light armor, one skill from the class's list|
|Sentinel||Light armor, simple lightweapons, one skill from the class's list|

## Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. Some features, however, have additional rules when you're multiclassing, as shown below.

### Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do. 

### Superiority and Maneuvers
If you have levels in multiple classes that have superiority features:
- **Maneuvers Known:** Choose your maneuvers from each class separately and then combine them into a single pool.
- **Superiority Dice:** You add your superiority dice from each class together as a single pool.
- **Die Size:** Add your levels in each class together and compare the total to any of your class's superiority tables to determine the size of your superiority die.

### Unarmored Defense
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

### Force- and Tech-casting
Your capacity for force- and tech-casting depends partly on your combined levels in all your force- or tech-casting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the force- or tech-casting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the force- or tech-casting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

#### Powers Known 
You determine what powers you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a scout 4/consular 3, for example, you know 6 tech powers of no higher than 1st-level. As a 3rd-level consular, you know 11 force powers of no higher than 2nd-level.

Each power you know is associated with one of your classes, and you use the force- or tech-casting ability of that class when you cast the power. 

#### Force and Tech Points 
You determine your available force or tech points by adding together the amount given by each class, but you only add your casting modifier once. 

If you have both force and tech points, you keep your pools separate, and they can only be used to fuel force or tech powers, respectively.

#### Max Power Level
When multiclassing, you determine your Max Power Level by dividing each class's potential Max Power Level by 9, multiplying the result by the number of levels in that class, adding the results for each class together, and consulting the Multiclass Max Power Level table below. 

For instance, if you have four levels in Marauder Approach berserker (1.77) and three levels in guardian (1.67), you count as a 3rd-level character when determining your Max Power Level, which is 2. While you don't know any 2nd-level powers, you can cast powers you know at that level.

If you have both force- and tech-casting, you determine your Max Power Levels separately, and they can only be used to cast force or tech powers, respectively.

##### Multiclass Max Power Level
|Caster Level|Slot Level|
|:---:|:--:|
| 1st|1st|
| 2nd|1st|
| 3rd|2nd|
| 4th|2nd|
| 5th|3rd|
| 6th|3rd|
| 7th|4th|
| 8th|4th|
| 9th|5th|
|10th|5th|
|11th|6th|
|12th|6th|
|13th|7th|
|14th|7th|
|15th|8th|
|16th|8th|
|17th|9th|
|18th|9th|
|19th|9th|
|20th|9th|

#### High-Level Casting
When determining the number of higher level powers you can cast before needing a long rest, consult the rules for casting in the class in which you have the most levels.

## Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow, perhaps by a withering curse, you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.
