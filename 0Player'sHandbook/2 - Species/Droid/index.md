# Droid
These rules serve as a rework of the current Droid player character species.

## Players as Droids
Unlike Droid NPCs, player controlled droids can be considered Droid heroes or villans and are assumed either to be "self-owned" or to be owned by another player character (with the approval of both the Game Master and the player in question). Even if owned by another member of the party, the Game Master should ensure that the owner does not abuse their authority by giving unreasonable or unwanted orders to the other player's Droid character.

A Droid player character should be treated the same as any other player character, and in most cases it is best to give suggestions or advice instead of actual orders. (In fact, most Droid player characters have a Heuristic Processor so that they can creatively interpret orders and thus justify acting as they wish.)

When you decide to play a Droid, you'll have to pack out a few details about what type of Droid your character will be. This is the equivalent of picking a Species for a non-Droid character.

Work with your GM to determine if playing as a droid is appropriate for your campaign. Droids are impervious to many effects and vulnerable to others. If your GM approves this choice of species, Work with them to determine your droids designation, name, and appearance. If you want to play a different type of droid, work with your GM to find suitable traits to realize your character.

## Droid Class
Droids are classified by a Droid Class, reflecting the types of tasks they typically perform. Generally, Class I Droids are medical and analytical Droids, Class II Droids are mechanical and technical Droids, Class III Droids are protocol and domestic Droids, Class IV Droids are security and battle Droids, and Class V Droids are labor and utility Droids. A Droid's function does not have to match its Droid Class, but this is uncommon.

> A couple examples of droids whose functions do not match their class are pilot droids and small repair droids such as mouse droids, who are normally Class V droids. However in SW5e Medium Class II and Tiny Class II fit these two droids better respectively. Discuss with your GM on what Droid Class might fit your character better.

Pick a Droid Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th) for your Droid. This determines your Ability Score modifiers, as shown in the table below. For example, a 3rd-Degree Protocol Droid's Charisma score increases by 2, and thier Intelligence or Wisdom score increases by 1.

|||
|:--|:--|
**Droid Class** | **TYPICAL ROLES**
Droid Class I: | Interrogation, Mathematics, Medical, Scientific
Droid Class II: | Astromech, Technical
Droid Class III: | Protocol, Service
Droid Class IV: | Assassin, Battle, Combat, Security
Droid Class V: | Labor, Utility

## Droid Traits
All classes of droids come with the following traits.

***Type.*** <br>
Your creature type is droid in addition to having a specific class of droid, either a class I, II, III, IV, V, or Tracker.

***Armor Integration.*** <br>
You can not wear armor, but you can have the armor professionally integrated into your chassis over the course of a long rest. This work must be done by someone proficient with astrotech's implements. You must be proficient in armor in order to have it integrated. 

Additionally you no longer require a tech focus or wristpad to cast tech powers.

***Droid Resistances.*** <br>
You are resistant to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and are immune to diseases as well as effects that inflict the poisoned condition.

***Droid Vulnerabilities.*** <br>
You are vulnerable to ion damage. Additionally, you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal ion or lightning damage.

***Force-Insensitive.*** <br>
While droids can be manipulated by many force powers, they can not sense the Force. You can not use force powers or take levels in forcecasting classes.

***Maintenance Mode.*** <br>
Rather than sleep, you must spend 3 hours performing routine maintenance during a long rest to gain its benefits, during which you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it.

***Nonliving.*** <br>
You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe; and while exposed to a low pressure environment, you can survive indefinitely.

***Rapid Reconstruction.*** <br>
You are built with internal repair mechanisms. As a bonus action, you can choose to spend one of your Hit Dice to recover hit points. 

***Languages.*** <br>
All droids can read, write, and process both Galactic Basic and [Binary](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binary). Your class determines if you can speak Galactic Basic or [Binary](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binary), but not both. If you can only speak Binary, you also cannot speak additional languages learned from other sources.

- *Droid Class I:* Can speak Galactic Basic or [Binary](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binary)
- *Droid Class II:* Can speak [Binary](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binary)
- *Droid Class III:* Can speak Galactic Basic
- *Droid Class IV:* Can speak Galactic Basic or [Binary](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binary)
- *Droid Class V:* Can speak [Binary](https://swse.fandom.com/wiki/Binary)

## Droid Size
You can choose to play a Medium, Small or Tiny Droid; dependent on your chosen Droid Class. Droids of larger sizes exist, but they are normally only controlled by the GM.

A Droid's size might influence its Ability Score modifiers or additional traits based on its class.

## Droid Customization
Some player's might want further customization for thier chosen class. Discuss with your GM, about replacing your Background feat the ***Customized Droid*** feat. 

### Customized Droid
You’ve been customized beyond other droids of the same model, granting the following benefits:

- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Choose one *Droid Customization* of standard rarity. That customization is installed and doesn’t count against the maximum *Droid Customizations* you can support, but it does count towards your maximum parts or protocols, as appropriate.

## Sharded Droid
Additionally, some players might want to be Droids that can utilize The Force. Discuss with your GM, about replacing your Background feat ***Shard Modification*** feat if you want to play create a force wielding droid.

### Shard Modification
You are specially modified droid used to house a shard. Shards are sentient crystals native to the planet Orax, roughly a foot in length, that communicate with each other through pulses of light. While inhabiting a specialized droid host, shards are able to overcome the droid’s inability to wield the Force, granting the following benefits:

- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You lose the Force-Insensitive special trait.
- You can cast the *Sense Force* force power once per day. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting ability for this power.
