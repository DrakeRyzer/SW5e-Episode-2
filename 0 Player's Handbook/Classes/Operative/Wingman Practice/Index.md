# Wingman Practice

Those operatives who choose the Wingman Practice only feel truly alive in the cockpit of a starfighter or speeder, where they can pit themselves against their peers in a life-and-death contest to see who is the better pilot. For some Wingmen, being adept at flying in tight formations with your allies, working together with them to achieve your goals and using your vehicle to shield others from harm is enough. The best Wingmen learn to stop enemies without destroying them, but those Wingmen are rare, and their exploits are legendary.

## Expert Pilot
***Wingman Practice:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level* <br>
You learn to expertly manuever any vehicle to avoid enemy fire. When piloting a vehicle, you can add +1 to the AC of the vehicle. This increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 17th level.

Additionally, you can deal Sneak Attack damage with any vehicle or starship weapon.

Lastly, you donâ€™t need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against vehicles or starships no more than two sizes larger than you (or your starship) if an allied vehicle is within 5 feet of you (or within 50 feet of an allied starship), as long as the target of the attack is below its hit point maximum. You do not need to be piloting a vehicle to use this feature. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.

> If you are using the *Starships of the Galaxy* ruleset. You also gain 1 rank in a deployment of your choice. This rank does not count towards or affect your prestige and the maximum number of ranks you can gain in deployments increases by 1. You can still only gain 5 ranks in a single deployment.

## Crack Shot
***Wingman Practice:** 3rd level* <br>
You learn a number of crack shots you can use to debilitate enemies and vehicle systems alike. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature; or vehicle no more than two sizes larger than you (or your starship), you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a crack shot. 

Some of your crack shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the crack shot's effects, vehicles have advantage unless you're attacking with a vehicle or starship weapon. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

**Crack Shot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

#### Concentrating Shot
You assist allies in concentrating fire on the target. Allied attacks have advantage on the target until the end of your next turn. This effect can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.

#### Shocking Shot
You attempt to shock the target. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be shocked until the end of your next turn.  

#### Hampering Shot
You attempt to hobble the enemy's movement. The target must make a Dexterity or Constitution saving throw (its choice). If it fails, it gains 1 slowed level and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the end of its next turn.
