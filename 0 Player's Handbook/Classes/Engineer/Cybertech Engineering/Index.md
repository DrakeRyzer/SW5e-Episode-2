# Cybertech Engineering

<img src='../../../../Images/Classes/Cybertech.png' style='float:right; width:300px;'>

Those engineers who choose the Cybertech Engineering discipline focus on the ability to enhance their primary wristpad in order to augment and empower their techcasting abilities.

### Bonus Proficiencies
***Cybertech Engineering:** 3rd level* <br>
You gain proficiency in cybertech's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with cybertech's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

### Cyberpad
***Cybertech Engineering:** 3rd level* <br>
Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your wristpad. You must have a wristpad and cybertech's implements in order to perform this modification.

Your wristpad requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified wristpad has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer class table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

### Insightful Casting
***Cybertech Engineering:** 3rd level* <br>
You can expend uses of your Potent Aptitude to gain additional tech points, or expend tech points to gain additional Potent Aptitude uses. 

*Creating Tech Points.* You can transform a single use of Potent Aptitude into two tech points as a bonus action on your turn. These additional tech points can exceed your maximum. Any tech points you create with this feature vanish when you finish a short rest.

*Creating Potent Aptitude.* As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend two tech points to gain a single use of your Potent Aptitude.

### Quickslice
***Cybertech Engineering:** 6th level* <br>
When a creature you can see casts a tech power, you may use your reaction to attempt to download that tech power to your wristpad for later use if it is of a level for which you can cast. 

Make an ability check using your techcasting ability with proficiency. The DC equals 10 + two times the power’s level. On a success you store the power for later use. On a failure, the power is not stored. You can cast powers stored in your wristpad as if you had learned them and they do not count against your tech powers known.

Once you have used this feature on a creature, you cannot do so again on the same creature until you complete a short or long rest.

You can store an amount of levels worth of tech powers equal to your engineer level at a time. Additionally, you can choose replace or remove one or more tech powers learned by this feature each time you use it.

### Severe Fallout
***Cybertech Engineering:** 14th level* <br>
Whenever a creature rolls a natural 1 on a saving throw against one of your tech powers they take double damage from that power. If the power doesn't deal damage, instead they have disadvantage on their next saving throw against a tech power you cast.

### Maximum Output
***Cybertech Engineering:** 18th level* <br>
When you cast a tech power, you can choose to deal maximum damage or provide maximum healing with that power.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
