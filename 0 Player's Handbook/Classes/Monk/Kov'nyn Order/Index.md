<img src='../../../Images/Classes/KovnynOrder.png' style='float:right; width:350px;'>

Mandalorians, well known for their prowess in unarmed combat, were trained in Kov'nyn. A style which utilized the protection their armor afforded them in an offensive manner. Although they would train and spar without weapons, this unique style allowed them effective use of weapons, especially ones afixed to their arms and armor. 

Kov'nyn was also the Mandalorian term for a headbutt, performed while wearing a helmet. 

### One with your armor
***Kov'nyn Order:** 3rd level* 
You gain proficiency in light and medium armor. If you are already proficient in light and medium armor, you instead gain proficiency in heavy armor. Additionally, you can now gain the benefits of your Martial Arts and Unarmored Movement features while wearing armor as long as you are not wielding a medium or heavy shield.

Additionally, any weapons that have the *fixed* property and don’t have the *dexterity*, *heavy*, or *two-handed* properties, are considered your Kov'nyn weapons and count as monk weapons for you. When you are wielding a Kov'nyn weapon, you gain the following benefits:

- You can benefit from fixed weapons while the hand is full.
- You can spend 10 feet of movement to reload fixed weapons.
- You no longer need a free hand to reload a one-handed weapon.

### Customized Gauntlet
***Kov'nyn Order:** 6th level*<br> 
You gain proficiency in munitions kit. Over the course of a long rest, you can customize one Kov'nyn weapon with additional weaponry. You must have the weapon and munitions kit in order to perform this modification. You can only have one customized Kov'nyn weapon at a time.

Your customized Kov'nyn weapon gains two features listed below. You can use these features three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 2 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 2 until you complete a long rest.

#### Grappling wire
You can use a bonus action to launch a grappling line at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line towards you. Alternatively you can pull yourself 10 feet in a straight line towards the target. If at the end of this movement the target is within 5 feet of you, you can roll a Martial Arts die and deal damage equal to the amount rolled.

#### Integrated Wrist Launcher
You integrate a wrist launcher into your customized gauntlet weapon. Additionally, weapon attacks with this weapon deal additional damage equal to your Martial Arts die. 

You can choose this upgrade multiple times. Each time you do so the weapon’s reload number increases by 1.

#### Repulsor
As a bonus action, you can activate the repulsor on a creature within 5 feet of you. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can roll a Martial Arts die and deal damage equal to the amount rolled and if the creature is Medium or smaller, it is pushed up to 10 feet in a straight line away from you.

#### Shield emitter
As a reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack, you gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. This includes the triggering attack.

#### Wrist flamer
As an action, each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from you must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3dX fire damage on a failed save, where X is equal to your Martial Arts die, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

### Keldabe kiss
***Kov'nyn Order:** 11th level* <br>
Whenever a creature fails their save against your stunning strike feature, you can spend one ki point to have that creature become unconscious for 1 minute, until it takes damage, or until someone uses an action to awaken the creature. At the end of an affected creature’s turn, it can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.
