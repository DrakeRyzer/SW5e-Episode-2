### Appearance
Class V droids are typically vaguely human-like in both shape and size, standing at around 6 feet, although many can be larger. They are usually a polished metallic color, though this can vary based on tasks for which they are created, their affiliation, or quirks of their owner.

They are noteworthy for their simple programming and quiet, focused work habits.

### Utility
Class V droids are programmed for menial and low-skill tasks. Such droids tend to perform basic tasks such as construction, lifting, maintenance, mining, sanitation, and transportation. Labor droids are fifth-degree droids.

### Names
Droids are typically called by their designation, given to them when they are created, or some affectation given to them by their owner. Often this affectation is a play on their designation. Occasionally, noteworthy droids will earn monikers based on their accomplishments.

**Designations (Names).** CO-34 (See-Oh Three Four), FX-9 (Effex), PK-4 (Pook), SAE-B13 (Sable)
