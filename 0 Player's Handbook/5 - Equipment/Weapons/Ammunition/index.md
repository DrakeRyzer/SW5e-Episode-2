### Kolto Dart
**Cost:** 600 credits <br>
This wrist launcher ammunition restores hit points to a beast or humanoid. This ammunition must be fired within normal range and automatically hits an allied target. 

The creature rolls one die equal to the size of their Hit Die and regains hit points equal to the amount rolled + their Constitution modifier (minimum of one hit point). If the creature has Hit Dice of different sizes, use whichever Hit Die size they have the most of.
