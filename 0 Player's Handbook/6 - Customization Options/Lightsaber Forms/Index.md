# Lightsaber Forms

Lightsaber forms are a series of schools of martial arts specialized in using the Force in conjunction with a lightsaber, although they were not limited to those methods.

Certain class features, Formfighting Style, and Formfighting Mastery, offer your choice of lightsaber forms. You can't choose a lightsaber form more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

You may choose your lightsaber forms from the following options or roll on the table below to determine them randomly.
