# Customization Options

The combination of ability scores, species, class, and background defines your character’s capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who-with the GM’s permission-want to go a step further.

This section defines various optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. 

***Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.***
