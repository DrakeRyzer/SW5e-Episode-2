# 3rd-Level Force Powers

### Force Redirect	
*3rd-level universal power*
<br>*Prerequiste:* Force Reflect
<br>*Casting Time:* 1 reaction, which you take in response to being dealt damage by a ranged attack
<br>*Range:* Self
<br>*Duration:* Instantaneous

In response to being attacked, you attempt to redirect the attack with the Force. When you use this power, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 3d10. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can redirect the attack, including any on-hit effects, at a target within range as part of the same reaction. Make a ranged force attack at a target you can see. The attack has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 90 feet. On a hit, the target takes the triggering attack’s normal damage.

**Force Potency.** When you cast this power using a force slot of 5th level or higher, the damage reduction increases by 2d10 for every two slot levels above 5th.

### Force Diversion	
*3rd-level universal power*
<br>*Prerequiste:* Force Reflect
<br>*Casting Time:* 1 reaction, which you take in response to being affected by a hand- or force-thrown object
<br>*Range:* 30 feet
<br>*Duration:* Instantaneous

In response to being affected by a hand or force-thrown object, such as a grenade or an object thrown with the Force, you attempt to divert the object with the Force. When you use this power, make an ability check using your forcecasting ability. If it is an object, such as a grenade, the DC equals 15. If it is an object thown by a power the DC equals 10 + the power’s level. On a success, you divert the object to a creature or at a new point within 30ft.

### Mass Force Disarm	
*3rd-level universal power*
<br>*Prerequiste:* Force Disarm
<br>*Casting Time:* 1 action
<br>*Range:* Self (15-foot cone)
<br>*Duration:* Instantaneous

Each weapon or object being worn or carried by a Large or smaller creature in a 15-foot cone originating from you must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the creature chooses the ability to use). If the item is being carried, this save is made with advantage. On a failed save, the item is pulled directly to you. Every item lands at your feet. If you have a free hand, you can catch one item instead. 

**Force Potency.** When you cast this power using a force slot of 5th or 6th level, the cone increases to 60 feet. At 7th or 8th level, the cone increases to 120 feet. At 9th level, the cone increases to 250 feet.
