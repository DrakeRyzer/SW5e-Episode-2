# 1st-Level Force Powers

### Force Reflect	
*1st-level universal power*
<br>*Prerequiste:* Saber Reflect
<br>*Casting Time:* 1 reaction, which you take in response to being dealt damage by a ranged attack
<br>*Range:* Self
<br>*Duration:* Instantaneous

In response to being attacked, you attempt to deflect the attack with the Force. When you use this power, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10. If the damage is energy, force, ion, kinetic, lightning, necrotic, or sonic, you can reflect the attack at a target within range as part of the same reaction. Make a ranged force attack at a target you can see. The attack has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 90 feet. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to the damage reduced, of the same type as the triggering attack.

**Force Potency.** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage reduction increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

# At-will Force Powers

### Force Returning
*1st-level universal power*
<br>*Prerequisite:* Saber Throw
<br>*Casting Time:* 1 bonus action
<br>*Range:* Touch
<br>*Duration:* Up to 1 minute (Concentration)

You touch can up to two lightweapons or vibroweapons you are wielding. For the duration, the weapons have the returning and thrown (30/90) properties for you.

**Force Potency.** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the thrown property's range increases by 30/90 feet for each slot level above 1st.

### Sustained Lightning (rework)	
*1st-level dark power*
<br>*Prerequiste:* Shock
<br>*Casting Time:* 1 action
<br>*Range:* 30 feet
<br>*Duration:* Concentration, up to 1 minute

You lash out against a creature within range with continual jolts of Force lightning. Make a ranged force attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The power ends if you use your action to do anything else. The power also ends if the target ends its turn outside the powerâ€™s range or if it has total cover from you.

**Force Potency.** When you cast this power with a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial and subsequent damage increases by 1d12 for every two slot levels above 1st.
