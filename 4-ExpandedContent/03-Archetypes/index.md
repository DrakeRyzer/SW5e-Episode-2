## Addicted Approach
For some, the consumption of substances is the entirety of their life. For berserkers of the Addicted Approach, substances cause their fury to burn stronger and deeper, granting significant benefits.

### Slythmonger Savvy
_**Addicted Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in your choice of brewer's kit or spicer's kit. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid the low or addiction to substances. Lastly, you can consume substances as a bonus action, and when you do so, you can also enter a rage as a part of this same bonus action.

### Freedom Through Slavery
_**Addicted Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
While you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, you have advantage on saving throws that would force you to act against your will, be frightened, or prevent you from attacking a creature. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you are instead immune to effects that would force you to act against your will or would prevent you<br> from attacking a creature.

### Release the Beast
_**Addicted Approach:** 6th level_<br>
While you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a Hit Die to deal additional damage to the target. Roll the Hit Die, adding the result of the die to the damage roll. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you also add your Constitution modifier to the damage roll.

### Seeing Sound
_**Addicted Approach:** 10th level_<br>
While you are raging or experiencing the high of a substance, you have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. If you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, you instead have blindsight with a range of 30 feet. If you would already have blindsight, it instead increases by 5 feet or 15 feet, respectively.

### Fuel the Rampage
_**Addicted Approach:** 14th level_<br>
While you are both raging and experiencing the high of a substance, having 0 hit points doesn't knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.

## Armored Approach



Many berserkers forgo armor and rely on their own fortitude. Berserkers of the Armored Approach, however, embrace the use of armor. Each one customizes their own suit of armor to be used both defensively and offensively, so that the suit becomes an extension of the berserker's own might and fury.

### Spiked Armor
_**Armored Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in armormech's implements. Over the course of a long rest, you can customize a suit of light or medium armor into spiked armor. You must have the armor and armormech's implements in order to perform this modification. You can only have one suit of spiked armor at a time.

This armor gains the barbed (1d4) property. If the armor already has the barbed property, the barbed damage increases by one step (from d4 to d6, or from d6 to d8). Additionally, while raging, you add your rage damage bonus to your barbed damage when you successfully initiate or maintain a grapple.

While wearing your spiked armor, you can use your Constitution modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier when determining your AC.

Additionally, while wearing your spiked armor, you can use your spiked armor as an improvised weapon. When you do so, you are considered proficient with it, and if your armor's barbed damage would be higher than your damage with improvised weapons, you use the barbed damage instead. If you take the Attack action on your turn and make at least one attack with your spiked armor, you can use your bonus action to make an additional attack with your spiked armor against the same target.

### Environmental Shielding
_**Armored Approach:** 6th level_<br>
You customize your spiked armor to better protect you. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic. While wearing your spiked armor, you have resistance to damage of the chosen type. Over the course of a long rest, you can select a different damage type, provided you have the armor and armormech's implements with you.

Additionally, while wearing your spiked armor, you have advantage on Constitution<br> saving throws made to avoid<br> exhaustion due to extreme heat<br> or cold.



### Customized Armor
_**Armored Approach:** 10th level_<br>
You learn new ways to customize your spiked armor. Choose one of the following options. While wearing your spiked armor, you gain the effects of the chosen option. Over the course of a long rest, you can select a different option, provided you have the armor and armormech's implements with you.

#### Defensive Field
On your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 + your berserker level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### Deflective Layer
Your armor class increases by 1.

#### Grappling Line
You can use a bonus action to launch a grappling line at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line towards you. If it ends this movement within 5 feet of you, it takes kinetic damage from your armor spikes equal to your Strength modifier.

#### Integrated Sonar
You can use an action to give yourself the benefits of the *true sight* force power for 1 hour. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### Neural Interface
You are immune to all effects that would cause you to be charmed or frightened.

### Spiked Retribution
_**Armored Approach:** 14th level_<br>
When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes kinetic damage equal to your Strength modifier, as long as you are wearing your spiked armor and you aren't incapacitated.

If you are raging, you add your rage damage bonus to this damage.

## Beastmaster Approach



Many berserkers feel a primal attunement to nature. For berserkers of the Beastmaster Approach, that attunement manifests itself in bestial marks and manifestations that grant the berserker newfound abilities.

### Bestial Fury
_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
While raging, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks.

Additionally, once on each of your turns while raging, you can mark a creature you can see as your prey for the duration of your rage (no action required). When you do so, once per turn when you deal damage to the creature with a weapon attack, you deal an additional 1d4 damage of the same type. Once per turn when the creature deals damage to you with a weapon attack, you take an additional 1d4 damage of the same type. This die increases to d6 at 5th level, d8 at 9th level, d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level. You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time.

### Pack Tactics
_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
When you have advantage on an attack roll against a creature, another enemy of the creature is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, you can reroll one of the dice once.



### Animalistic Momentum
_**Beastmaster Approach:** 6th level_<br>
You gain a your choice of a climbing or swimming speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you gain an effect while raging based on your choice of speed:
- If you chose a climbing speed, you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- If you chose a swimming speed, you can use your bonus action to Dash or Disengage while in water.

### Lick Wounds
_**Beastmaster Approach:** 10th level_<br>
Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points while raging, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your berserker level, which last for the duration of your rage.

### Hunter's Call
_**Beastmaster Approach:** 14th and 17th level_<br>
When you enter your rage, you can choose up to 5 allies that you can see within 30 feet of you. You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature. For the duration of your rage, once on each of their turns, an affected ally can add your rage damage bonus to a weapon attack's damage roll.

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.



<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/YqU2kRu.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:10px;left:200px;width:500px;z-index:1000;'/> --->




## Beastmaster Approach (Companion)



Many berserkers feel a primal attunement to nature. For berserkers of the Beastmaster Approach, that attunement manifests itself in a bond with a beast companion that accompanies a berserker on his journey.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in Animal Handling.

### Beast Companion
_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to capitalize on a primal attunement to nature to forge a powerful bond with your own beast companion.

Create your beast companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. 

In addition to its traits and features, your beast companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:
- Your beast gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each beast trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your number of available Hit Dice that can be spend to restore hit points is reduced by 1.

Lastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, your beast companion gains the benefits of one of your chosen instincts. If that instinct relies on raging, your beast companion gains the benefits of that instinct while you are raging.

At 11th level, your companion must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your companion must be within 60 feet.

### Pack Tactics
_**Beastmaster Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
When you have advantage on an attack roll against a creature your companion has dealt damage since the start of your last turn, you can reroll one of the dice once. When your companion has advantage on an attack roll against a creature you've dealt damage since the start of your last turn, it can reroll one of the dice once.



### Animalistic Momentum
_**Beastmaster Approach:** 6th, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
Your bond with your beast companion strengthens, granting the following benefits while your beast companion is within 10 feet of you:
- If you or your beast have a climbing or swimming speed and the other doesn't, the other gains it with the same speed. If you both have the a climbing or swimming speed, you both use the larger speed of the two, which then increases by 5 feet.
- Whenever your beast deals damage to a hostile creature you can see on your turn, it counts as you taking a hostile action for the purposes of maintaining your rage.

This radius increases to 30 feet at 11th level 60 feet at 17th level.

### Lick Wounds
_**Beastmaster Approach:** 10th level_<br>
Whenever your companion reduces a creature to 0 hit points while you are raging, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your berserker level, which last for the duration of your rage.

### Hunter's Call
_**Beastmaster Approach:** 14th and 17th level_<br>
When you enter your rage, you can choose up to 5 allies that you can see within 30 feet of you. You gain 5 temporary hit points for each creature. For the duration of your rage, once on each of their turns, an affected ally can add your rage damage bonus to a weapon attack's damage roll.

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Bloodstorm Approach
The Bloodstorm Approach is said to have originated from the ancient wookiee Hroufrasnooohn clan (which loosely translates to Bloodstorm in Galactic Basic), whose warriors performed gravity-defying feats with their flying vibroaxes through a combination of unorthodox techniques and a mystical belief in their own abilities. A berserker who follows this approach can hurl their devastating weapons at enemies with such power and skill that it completely blurs the line between melee and ranged combat.

### Furious Throw
_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
Your throwing techniques have become a perfect extension of your melee prowess. When you throw a weapon with which you are proficient, you can benefit from your class features that only apply to melee weapon attacks, such as Rage or Reckless Attack.

### Returning Attacks
_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
Any weapon you throw can ricochet back to you at your command. When you make a thrown weapon attack, you may have the weapon fly back to your hand immediately after the attack.

### Throw Anything
_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Your strength and mastery of throwing techniques has allowed you to throw vibroaxes as easily as others hurl vibrodaggers. When you are wielding a light- or vibro-weapon with which you are proficient, it gains the thrown property (range 20/60).

### Fling People
_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 10th level_<br>
You learn to throw creatures as easily as you throw your weapons. When you successfully grapple a creature, you may immediately throw the creature.

#### Throw Friend
If the creature is a willing ally and volunteers<br> to be grappled, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 60 feet. That creature<br> may immediately use its reaction to make one<br> melee weapon attack, adding your Strength<br> modifier to the attack's damage roll.

#### Throw Foe
If the creature is an opponent, you throw the target into any unoccupied space within 30 feet, where it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier and falls prone.





### Raging Whirlwind
_**Bloodstorm Approach:** 14th level_<br>
You can send your weapon spinning into a gravity-defying whirlwind of pain. Once per rage as an action, you may throw a weapon with the thrown property to a point you choose within 60 feet. The weapon fills the air as a cyclone in a 10 foot radius sphere centered on that point. A creature takes damage equal to the thrown weapon's damage + your Strength modifier + your Rage Damage when it enter's the whirlwind's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. This effect ends when you command the weapon to return to you (no action required) or your rage ends.

## Brawling Approach
Most berserkers require weapons. For berserkers of the Brawling Approach, however, everything is their weapon.

### Fists of Fury
_**Brawling Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You've learned to hone your rage through your fists. Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).

### Reckless Strikes
_**Brawling Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
While you are raging, not wearing heavy armor, and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to forgo your rage damage to make the attack a reckless strike.

Some of your reckless strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the reckless strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___


**Reckless Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Strength modifier


___

You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

#### Bracing Strike
You gain temporary hit points equal to your rage damage bonus. If the target is grappled by you, you instead gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rage damage bonus.

#### Punishing Strike
Your target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is deafened until the start of its next turn. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead incapacitated until the start of its next turn.

#### Staggering Strike
Your target must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability score to use). On a failed save, your target is pushed back 5 feet. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead knocked prone.

### Shattering Strikes
_**Brawling Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Your rage causes your strikes to overcome the hardest of materials. While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.
- Your unarmed strikes deal double damage against structures.




### Stop Hitting Each Other
_**Brawling Approach:** 10th level_<br>
You can grapple creatures two sizes larger than you, instead of one. 

Additionally, you can use creatures you have grappled that are at least one size smaller than you as improvised weapons. When you do so, when you hit with an attack using a creature as a weapon, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.

### Enforcer
_**Brawling Approach:** 14th level_<br>
When you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, your critical hit range increases by 1 for that attack, and on a hit, you deal maximum damage instead of rolling.

## Champion Approach



Some berserkers revel in battle for battle's sake. For berserkers of the Champion Approach, this revelry is the goal to which they constantly strive.

### Champion Superiority
_**Champion Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. See chapter 13 for the maneuvers list.

#### Maneuvers Known
You learn two maneuvers of your choice, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the Champion Superiority table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.

Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

#### Superiority Dice
You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Quantity column of the Champion Superiority table. This die changes as you gain berserker levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Size column of the Champion Superiority table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. 

You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Maneuver Ability
Your maneuver ability varies based on the type of the maneuver you use. You use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for physical maneuvers (your choice), Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for mental maneuvers (your choice), and an ability of your choice for general maneuvers. You use this ability whenever a maneuver refers to your maneuver ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a maneuver you use.

___



**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your maneuver ability modifier



___

### Reckless Maneuvers
_**Champion Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
When you use your Reckless Attack feature, you have advantage on superiority die rolls that would be added to the attack or damage rolls of your affected attacks.





##### Champion Superiority
|Level|Maneuvers<br> Known|Superiority<br> Dice Quantity|Superiority<br> Dice Size|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|

|18th|11|6|d12|
|19th|12|6|d12|
|20th|12|6|d12|



### The Thrill
_**Champion Approach:** 6th level_<br>
You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being charmed or frightened, and creatures can't have advantage on ability checks or saving throws to avoid being charmed or frightened by effects that you control.

### Battlefield Euphoria
_**Champion Approach:** 10th level_<br>
While raging, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, and when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack, you recover an expended superiority die.

### Furious Influence
_**Champion Approach:** 14th level_<br>
While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- You are resistant to psychic damage.
- When you affect an ally with a maneuver, they gain the benefit of one of your damage resistances until the start of your next turn.

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/nHytg2E.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:0px;left:100px;width:270px;z-index:1000;' /> --->





## Frenzied Approach
For some berserkers, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Frenzied Approach is that of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

### Frenzy
_**Frenzied Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You can go into a frenzy when you enter your rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one.

The first time you use this feature, you suffer no ill effect. If you use this feature again before you finish<br> a long rest, you suffer one level of exhaustion<br> when your rage ends each time you use<br> it.

When you finish a long rest, you<br> reduce your exhaustion level by 2,<br> instead of 1. Additionally, any<br> effect that removes exhaustion<br> reduces your exhaustion by 1<br> additional level.

### Maniacal Rage
_**Frenzied Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
While raging, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

### Mindless Rage
_**Frenzied Approach:** 6th level_<br>
You can't be charmed or frightened while raging.<br> If you are charmed or frightened when you enter<br> your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration<br> of the rage.

### Intimidating Presence
_**Frenzied Approach:** 10th level_<br>
You can use your action to frighten someone with<br> your menacing presence. When you do so, choose<br> one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. While raging, you add double your proficiency bonus to the save DC, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.

### Retaliation
_**Frenzied Approach:** 14th level_<br>
When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

## Industrial Approach
While some berserkers are content to surrender to their rage, others prefer a more tactful approach. Berserkers of the Industrial Approach augment their rage with the versatility of technology, adding elemental explosions to their already fearsome arsenal.




### Techcasting
_**Industrial Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You have derived powers from schematics with the aid of your wristpad. See chapter 10 for the general rules of techcasting and chapter 12 for the tech powers list.

#### Tech Powers Known
You learn 3 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

#### Tech Points
You have a number of tech points equal to half of your berserker level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Industrial Approach Techcasting table.

You may only cast tech powers at ;4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Techcasting Ability
Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___



**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier

___

**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your Intelligence modifier



___

#### Techcasting Focus
You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) as a tech focus for your tech powers.

### Industrious Tech
_**Industrial Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You can cast tech powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action and the power does not require concentration. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from tech powers you cast that require a tech attack or saving throw. If a tech power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them. 

Casting tech powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a tech power that requires a tech attack.

### Explosive Resilience
_**Industrial Approach:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
Once per round, when you deal damage that includes your rage damage, you can cause a localized explosion around the recipient of that damage. Each creature within 5 feet of the damaged creature other than you takes acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) equal to your rage damage bonus, and you gain resistance to the chosen damage type until the end of your next turn.

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Painkiller
_**Industrial Approach:** 10th level_<br>
Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, or deal damage using your Explosive Resilience feature, you can cause a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet to gain temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level + your Intelligence modifier. Additionally, while they have these temporary hit points, they have advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause them to be frightened.

### Final Countdown
_**Industrial Approach:** 14th level_<br>
When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, and you have at least one tech point remaining, you can expend all your remaining tech points and instead to drop to one hit point (no action required). If you do so, each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, they take 1d12 acid, cold, fire, ion, or lightning damage (your choice) damage for each tech point spent in this way, or half as much on a successful one.





##### Industrial Techcasting

## Precision Approach
Some berserkers have learned to channel their rage into a method of increasing their focus and precision to supernatural levels. Those berserkers who choose the Precision Approach hone their rage to a fine point, becoming agile warriors who ruthlessly dispatch their foes.

### Careful Steps
_**Precision Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain skills that represent your precise movement. You gain proficiency in your choice of Acrobatics or Stealth. While raging, you have advantage on checks you make with the chosen skill.

### Focused Rage
_**Precision Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You hone your rage to a razor sharp focus. While raging, when you make a melee weapon attack using Dexterity, you add your rage damage to the damage roll. Additionally, you can use your Reckless Attack feature to give you advantage on melee weapon attacks using Dexterity during your turn.

### Battle Anticipation
_**Precision Approach:** 6th level_<br>
While raging, your critical hit range with melee weapon attacks using Dexterity increases by 1.

### Improved Danger Sense
_**Precision Approach:** 10th level_<br>
While raging, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers, you are treated as proficient in the save, and you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Calm Within the Storm
_**Precision Approach:** 14th level_<br>
The precision with which you act during your rage causes you to become a storm of reactive lethality. When you use your Reckless Attack feature, you can make a number of opportunity attacks equal to your proficiency bonus without using your reaction, and when a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack using Dexterity against that creature. 

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/WTnjBcN.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-20px;right:-48px;width:550px;z-index:1000;' /> --->





## Warchief Approach
For some berserkers, it is their duty or birthright to lead their tribe and kin to battle and victory. The Warchief Approach is one forged from alliances, bonds, and strategy. In combat, your rages are less mindless, and more focused. Ignoring the distractions of unimportant events, your attention hones in on the battlefield and how best to direct and control it. You guide your allies' strikes, and your presence is enough to wash away their fatigue.




### Savage Diplomat
_**Warchief Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
Your path necessitates that you build relationships with others, for the betterment of your tribe or yourself. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Persuasion or Intimidation. You can choose to learn one language in place of the skill proficiency.

### Commanding Rage
_**Warchief Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You become more aware of your allies, and their intent when fighting at your side. While you are raging, when an ally within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an enemy, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack and add your rage damage bonus to the damage roll, if the attack hits.

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Inspiring Presence
_**Warchief Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Your mere presence on the battlefield rallies your allies. When you rage, choose up to 3 allies that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature gains temporary hit points equal to half your berserker level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).

### Raid Planning
_**Warchief Approach:** 10th level_<br>
You learn to flare up your allies' drive for combat, urging them to follow you into the fray. During a long rest, you tell sagas, sing battle songs, and give inspiring speeches. At the end of the long rest choose up to 5 creatures that can hear and understand you (which can include yourself) to add your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to their next Initiative check, and a 10 foot bonus to their speed on their first turn of combat.

### War Chant
_**Warchief Approach:** 14th level_<br>
You have memorized the litanies, songs, and chants of your people and their dedication to war. When you enter a rage on your turn, you can enter a commanding rage for one minute. When you do so, during this turn and at the start of each of your turns, you have a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus you can only use for your Commanding Rage feature. When you use Commanding Rage with these special reactions, they do not count against your uses of that feature. You can only use one reaction per turn. Additionally, during this rage, when an enemy within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll against an ally, you can use your reaction to reduce the attack by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

## Way of Confluence
The Force binds us, creating an intangible bridge connecting all living things. Those consulars who follow the Way of Confluence master this power, manipulating those connections to both sustain and torment.
 
### Manipulate Life Force
_**Way of Confluence:** 3rd level_<br>
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a force power, or restore hit points to a creature with 0 hit points with a force power, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).

### Empowered Connection

You can use your powerful connection to the<br> Force to keep fighting when others would fall.<br> When you are reduced to 0 hit<br> points but not killed outright,<br> you can spend 5 force points to<br> drop to 1 hit point instead. 





### Interconnectedness
_**Way of Confluence:** 14th and 17th level_<br>
When you cast a 5th level or lower force power that deals damage or restores hit points and targets only one creature, the power can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. 

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Dynamic Attachment
_**Way of Confluence:** 18th level_<br>
While you have temporary hit points, you have resistance against the damage of force powers, and your force powers ignore resistances. 

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/4ttaft8.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-11px;right:5px;width:620px;z-index:1000;' /> --->





## Way of Endurance
The Force manifests in myriad ways; while some use the Force to manipulate the world around them, others use it to enhance themselves. Those consulars who follow the Way of Endurance channel the Force to allow them to overcome and reflect the most grievous of injuries.
 
### Upheld by the Force
_**Way of Endurance:** 3rd level_<br>
The Force flowing through your body strengthens you, granting the following benefits:
- Your hit point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
- Your base AC becomes 13 + your Constitution modifier. 
- When you make a melee weapon attack as a part of a force power you cast, you can use Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls.

Additionally, as an action, you can gain resistance to kinetic and energy damage for 1 minute. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Retaliation Strike
_**Way of Endurance:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to turn an opponent's<br> aggression back on them. When<br> you deal damage with a force power<br> or a melee weapon attack, if you took<br> damage since the start of your last turn,<br> you deal an extra 1d6 damage. The damage<br> is the same type as the power or weapon's<br> damage.

This die increases when you reach certain levels<br> in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Boundless Vitality
_**Way of Endurance:** 10th level_<br>

This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.




### Unrelenting Resilience
_**Way of Endurance:** 14th level_<br>
When you use your Boundless Vitality feature while concentrating on a force power, you can add the result of the roll to the Constitution saving throw made to maintain concentration.

Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright while Upheld by the Force is active, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### The Force Unleashed
_**Way of Endurance:** 18th level_<br>
As an action, you can choose a point within 60 feet. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 force damage and suffers 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and does not suffer exhaustion.

For each creature that fails this saving throw, a friendly creature within 30 feet of them can regain hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. A friendly creature can only gain this benefit once per turn.

You can use this feature six times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Way of Manipulation
The power of the Force is both vast and diverse, with uses varying drastically based on their wielder. Those consulars who follow the Way of Manipulation learn to control their weapons with the Force, maneuvering them across the battlefield.

### Saber Storm
_**Way of Manipulation:** 3rd, 5th, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to deftly control your weapons utilizing the Force. As an action, you can initiate your Saber Storm. When you do so, select a light- or vibro-weapon within 5 feet that is not worn or carried by a conscious creature other than you, and use the Force to cause it to levitate, acting as an extension of your will for 1 minute. When you activate this feature, you can cause the weapon to move up to 10 feet and make a melee force attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + your forcecasting ability modifier damage. The type is of the normal damage dealt by the weapon. The weapon then returns to your side.

Your weapon moves with you, and while Saber Storm is active and you have a weapon animated, on each of your turns you can use an action to move a weapon up to 10 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon then returns to your side. Your Saber Storm ends early if you are incapacitated. At any time, you can end this feature and return the animated weapon to your hand.

Additionally, while your Saber Storm is active, and at least one animated weapon is within 5 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
- You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.
- You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a power. The bonus equals your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).

This feature can animate more than one weapon when you reach higher levels: two weapons<br> at 5th level, three weapons at 11th level,<br> and four weapons at 17th level. When<br> you use your action to attack with your<br> weapons, you can direct them at the<br> same target or at different ones. Make a<br> separate attack roll for each weapon.

At 5th level, the distance your weapon can travel increases to 20 feet. This distance increases to 30 feet at 11th level, and 40 feet at 17th level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Deceptive Strike
_**Way of Manipulation:** 6th level_<br>
When you cast a force power with a range of touch while Saber Storm is active, your animated weapon can move up to its range and deliver the power as if it had cast it. 




### Guarding Weapon
_**Way of Manipulation:** 10th level_<br>
You can direct your animated weapons to absorb damage while your Saber Storm is activate. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend a number of force points up to your proficiency bonus to have your animated weapon intercept it, and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal to five times the number of points spent.

### Isolate
_**Way of Manipulation:** 14th level_<br>
When you deal damage to a creature while Saber Storm is active, and that creature fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can steal and redirect the power. Until the end of your next turn, either you or the creature who failed the Constitution saving throw gain the effects of the power (your choice).

### Sapping Storm 
_**Way of Manipulation:** 18th level_<br>
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points while Saber Storm is active, you gain temporary force points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). These temporary force points can not exceed your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice), and when you would spend a force point while you have temporary force points, the temporary force points are spent first. When Saber Storm ends, you lose any remaining temporary force points.

## Way of Negation
Some force users seek mastery over the fundamentals of energy manipulation, known as tutaminis. Those consulars who follow the Way of Negation harness this power to limit the havoc that other force-wielders might wreak.

### Force Deflection
_**Way of Negation:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
When you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a bonus to that saving throw equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Power Surge
_**Way of Negation:** 6th level_<br>
You learn to simultaneously limit a creature's force powers and store that power within yourself to later strengthen your damaging force powers.

You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Whenever you successfully end a force power with a power such as *force suppression* or *sever force*, or use your Force Shield or Force Deflection features to successfully avoid an attack or succeed on a saving throw, you gain one power surge, as you redirect the flow of the Force into yourself. 




Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or object with a force power, you can spend one power surge to deal extra damage to that target. The extra damage is of the same type as the power's damage, and it equals half your consular level.

Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.

### Enduring Focus
_**Way of Negation:** 10th level_<br>
You can casually deflect attacks while channeling your power. While you are concentrating on a Force power, you have a +2 bonus to your AC and all saving throws.

Additionally, you can extend your Force Deflection to a creature within 5 feet of you when they fail a saving throw.

### Conflux
_**Way of Negation:** 14th level_<br>
When you use your Force Deflection feature, you can cause a ripple in the Force to expand from you. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal to half your consular level.

### Tutaminis Mastery
_**Way of Negation:** 18th level_<br>
When you use a Force-Empowered Casting option, you can spend a power surge to use it without spending additional force points. 

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/pq3knax.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-105px;right:-60px;width:1050px;z-index:1000' /> --->





## Way of the Seer
The Force guides us in innumerable ways, often manifesting as visions. Those consulars who follow the Way of Seer attempt to harness these visions in an attempt to work towards the best possible future, as they see it.

### Force Visions
_**Way of the Seer:** 3rd level_<br>
Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

### Powerful Mind
_**Way of the Seer:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You can use your force abilities to read a creature's thoughts. You can then use your access to the creature's mind to command it.

As an action, choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, you can't use this feature on it again until you finish a long rest. If the creature fails its save, you can read its surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During that time, you can use your action to end this effect and cast the *coerce mind* force power at its base level on the creature without expending force points. The target automatically fails its saving throw against the power. 

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.





### Visions of the Past
_**Way of the Seer:** 10th level_<br>
You can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a force power. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

***Object Reading.*** Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.

***Area Reading.*** As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.

### Shielded Thoughts
_**Way of the Seer:** 14th level_<br>
Your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do. 

### Clarity of Vision
_**Way of the Seer:** 18th level_<br>
The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Force Visions feature, rather than two. 

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/gqzswlS.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-120px;left:57px;width:545px;z-index:1000;' /> --->





## Way of Technology
While many Forcewielders eschew the use of technology, other choose to embrace it. Those consulars who follow the Way of Technology pair their mastery of the Force with the versatility of technology, applying the knowledge in tandem to perform unseen feats.
 
### Fundamentals of Mechu-deru
_**Way of Technology:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You've dabbled in adapting your use of the Force, melding it with technology. You gain proficiency in the Technology skill, as well as simple blasters. When you cast a force power that calls for a melee weapon attack, and you are wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you can instead make a ranged weapon attack.

Additionally, you've learned to manipulate the Force to be able to manipulate technology when it couldn't previously. When you cast a force power that could not affect droids or constructs, you can choose to have it affect droids or constructs. If it would affect multiple targets, you must expend additional uses of this feature for each additional target. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Techcasting Secrets
_**Way of Technology:** 6th, 7th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You've learned to mimic technological effects. Choose two tech powers of 1st level. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the consular table.

At 7th level, you learn two additional tech powers of 1st or 2nd level. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 1st-3rd level, and at 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 1st-4th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of the same level.

### Ionized Weave
_**Way of Technology:** 10th level_<br>
When you cast a damage-dealing force power that requires a force attack or saving throw, you can spend force points to cause that power to instead deal ion damage. The number of force points equals half the power's level (round down, minimum of one). If the power would call for a saving throw other than Dexterity, it instead calls for a Dexterity saving<br> throw. 





### Force Circuitry
_**Way of Technology:** 14th level_<br>
When you use your action to cast a force power, and you use your Fundamentals of Mechu-deru feature as a part of that casting, you can use your bonus action to cast one of the tech powers you know, as long as that power has a casting time of 1 action or bonus action.

### Mechu-deru Mastery
_**Way of Technology:** 18th level_<br>
You can cast one 5th-level tech power of your choice at its base level. The power counts as a universal force power for you, and you do not require force points to cast this power. Once you've done so, you can't do so again until you complete a long rest.

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/WrotCbm.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:28px;right:30px;width:523px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' /> --->





## Way of Telekinetics
The consular knows how to manipulate the essence of the surrounding elements with the power of the Force. Those consulars who follow the Way of Telekinetics create torrential gusts of telekinetic energy, forming a potent combination that can pummel even the toughest adversaries into submission.

## Construction Engineering
Those engineers who choose the Construction Engineering discipline create portable, pre-built battlements that allow them to command the battlefield.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Construction Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in constructor's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with constructor's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

### Portable Structure
_**Construction Engineering:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You have constructed a set of malleable, portable fortifications that can elevate you and your allies. Over the course of a long rest, you create a portable structure that travels with you. 

Your portable structure can only be directed by you, and you must have a tech focus in order to direct it remotely. If you lack a tech focus, you can instead direct it while it is within 5 feet of you. Your portable structure has the following features:
- Its AC equals your tech save DC.
- It has a number of hit points equal to 5 x your engineer level. If your structure is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses and can't be used again until you spend 1 hour repairing it, which can be done during a short or long rest.
- You can restore missing hit points to your structure by casting the *mending* tech power on it, or by completing a short or long rest. Casting the *mending* tech power restores a number of missing hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), but it can't be repaired to more than half its hit point maximum in this way. Completing a short rest restores your structure to half its hit point maximum, and completing a long rest restores it to its hit point maximum.
- Your structure has two modes: dismantled and deployed. While dismantled, your structure's speed equals your own, it hovers 5 feet off the ground, takes up the space of a 5-foot cube, and weighs 500 lbs. This increases to a 10-foot cube and 1,000 lbs. at 11th level, and a 15-foot cube and 2,000 lbs. at 17th level as you upgrade it. While deployed, your structure's speed is 0 and it takes up space dictated by how its deployed.

As an action, you can remotely deploy your structure at a space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, provided there is sufficient space to support it. This range increases to 60 feet at 11th level and 120 feet at 17th level. Automatic dismantling of your structure takes 1 minute, and can be initiated on your turn (no action required).

You can deploy your choice from these structures a combined total of four times, and you gain more uses at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. Each time you use this feature in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.




#### Bridge
You deploy a bridge up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 3 feet thick. The bridge starts from the point at which you deploy it, and extends in a direction of your choice. When you dismantle your bridge, it retracts to the point at which you initially deployed it. Both ends of the bridge must be supported in some fashion; one end cannot be suspended in the air or on unstable terrain. The bridge can hold up to 1,000 lbs., any weight above which causes the bridge to instantly drop to 0 hit points, destroying it. If a creature is on the bridge when it is destroyed or dismantled, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful saving throw, it reaches the closest part of the bridge that has stable support, or it maintains a grip on your bridge as it retracts, as appropriate. On a failed save, it falls. 

When you reach 11th level, the bridge can now extend up to 45 feet long, 15 feet wide, and it can support up to 2,000 lbs. When you reach 17th level, the bridge can now extend up to 60 feet long, 20 feet wide, and it can support up to 4,000 lbs.

#### Cage
You create a cage that surrounds a cube up to 10 feet on each side centered on the target location. The cube is surrounded on all sides except the ground by 2-foot-thick walls. The walls and roof are completely opaque, and you choose whether the structure has a light source when you deploy it that provides bright light within the cube. Otherwise, the space within the cube is in complete darkness. The cage is permeable, allowing air, water, and sound to pass through it. You can attempt to trap unwilling Medium or smaller creatures inside the cage. When you deploy this structure in an unwilling creature's space, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, it can immediately move to nearest unoccupied space outside of the cage. Otherwise, it is trapped within the structure when it is deployed. 

When you reach 11th level, the cage can extend up to 15 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Large size or smaller. When you reach 17th level, the cage can extend up to 20 feet on each side, and it can trap creatures of Huge size or smaller. 

#### Shelter
You erect a shelter up to 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall, with one-foot-thick walls, a roof, and a floor. It has a single door along its walls in a location of your choice. The building has temperature control and lighting systems, and can withstand harsh winds, heavy rain and snow. Any creature inside the shelter is protected from hazardous environmental effects outside the shelter such as extreme heat or cold. The structure does not provide additional breathing air for anyone inside if the environment it is placed in is not breathable. The shelter can comfortably support up to 5 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures.


When you reach 11th level, the shelter can extend up to 30 feet long, 15 feet wide, 15 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, they regain all spent Hit Dice, instead of only half. When you reach 17th level, the shelter can extend up to 45 feet long, 20 feet wide, 20 feet tall, and it can now comfortably support up to 10 Large creatures. For each Large creature, it can instead support 2 Medium creatures. For each Medium creature, it can instead support 2 Small creatures. For each Small creature, it can instead support 2 Tiny creatures. Additionally, when a creature completes a long rest while within your shelter, their exhaustion level is reduced by 2, instead of only 1.

#### Tower
You erect a tower from a 5-foot square platform centered on the target location that rises up to 30 feet. If the tower is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the tower. A creature can choose to fail the save. The tower comes equipped with a ladder that reaches from the ground to the platform. 

When you reach 11th level, the tower's platform can extend 5 feet by 10 feet and rise up to 40 feet. When you reach 17th level, the tower's platform can cover a 10-foot square, and rise up to 50 feet. Additionally, any creature on the tower's platform has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

#### Wall
You deploy a wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 10 feet in diameter, 10 feet high, and 3 feet thick. The wall features ramparts deep enough to support creatures of Medium size or smaller, and provides one-quarter cover to any creature on its ramparts. The wall includes a ladder on the side of your choice. You choose whether the wall contains any openings otherwise. Any openings chosen in this way can be seen through on both sides. The wall can be climbed, but requires a Strength (Athletics) check against your tech save DC for any creature without a climbing speed. A creature can only make this check once per turn. 

When you reach 11th level, the wall can deploy up to 45 feet long and 15 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 15 feet in diameter and 15 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides half cover to any creature on its ramparts. When you reach 17th level, the wall can deploy up to 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter and 20 feet high. Additionally, the wall now provides three-quarters cover to any creature on its ramparts.



### Potent Fortifications
_**Construction Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
When a friendly creature other than you that you can see is hit with a ranged attack while within 5 feet of your deployed portable structure, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to have your structure take the damage instead. If your structure would normally have immunity or resistance to this damage, it loses that immunity or resistance for this attack. When you do so, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to 1d10 + your Intelligence modifier + your engineer level.

### Build and Destroy
_**Construction Engineering:** 6th level_<br>
You've learned how to manipulate the weak points in structures with your technology. Your tech powers and weapon attacks gain the siege property, and your portable structures have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage dealt by weapons.

_**Construction Engineering:** 14th level_<br>
You can spend 1 hour inspecting and looking over a structure you can see from every angle available to you and comparing it to data you have on hand. At the end of the hour, you learn the basic blueprints for the structure, including but not limited to:
- The structure's total hit points.
- Any common materials that make up the structures.
- Whether or not the structure is in use or abandoned.
- The total floor count for the structure, as well as the general purpose of each floor if it was created to suit a specific purpose.
- All non-secret entrances (including doors, windows, vents, pipe systems) and where you could find them.
- A basic map-layout of every floor and ventilation system for the building.
- The history of the building such as what company or species could have constructed it, as well as how long it's been built.
- Any structural weak points it might have.

Additionally, when you make an Investigation check while searching this structure for hidden structural elements, such as doors or passages, if you have constructor's implements, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Master Builder
_**Construction Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
Your ability with your portable structures has reached untold superiority. You gain the following benefits:
- You can have two structures active at a time, instead of only one, as you learn to more efficiently use your portable structure.
- Your structures no longer take double damage from the siege property.
- Your structures no longer automatically fail Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. Instead, your structure adds your proficiency bonus to the d20 roll when it makes one of these saving throws.

You modify your goggles with a toggle allowing you to briefly gain enhanced sight. As a bonus action, you can activate the truesight feature of your goggles. When toggled on, for the next minute your goggles now automatically dispel illusions and can detect invisibility, as with truesight.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook
You craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this contraption, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.

A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.

While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.





## Adept Specialist
Those fighters who choose to become Adept Specialists tap into a latent Force-sensitivity to augment their martial prowess, blending the two to accelerate their bodies and blows. An adept speeds across the battlefield, attacking opponents in a flurry of blows before dashing off again.

### Forcecasting
_**Adept Specialist:** 3rd level_<br>
You have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Adept Specialist Forcecasting table.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your fighter level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Adept Specialist Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Adept Specialist Forcecasting table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.




#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___



**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

___

**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

### Growing Momentum
_**Adept Specialist:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Demolitions Specialist
Those fighters who choose to become Demolitions Specialists are experts in using explosives in combat. They have an explosive for every situation, whether it be breaching a fortified bunker, taking down a walker, or simply demonstrating that in combat, standing too close to your squadmates can be fatal.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Demolitions Specialist:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in demolitions kit. Additionally, when you would install a breaching charge, you can do so in half the time.

### Explosive Charge
_**Demolitions Specialist:** 3rd, 7th, and 15th level_<br>
You learn to create a number of small explosives known as charges. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create a number of charges equal to your Intelligence modifier. You must have a demolitions kit in order to create these charges. Your charges can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.

Once per turn, when you would make a ranged weapon attack, you can instead throw one of your charges. Your charges have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. You can throw a charge at a point you can see within range. Each creature within<br> 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC =<br> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier). A creature takes 2d4 + your<br> Intelligence modifier kinetic damage on a<br> failed save, or half as much on a successful one. 

The damage of your charges increases to 3d4<br> at 7th level and 4d4 at 15th level.

### Cause and Effect
_**Demolitions Specialist:** 7th level_<br>
You learn to throw grenades as a bonus action. Additionally, when a creature fails a saving throw against a charge or grenade, you can expend a superiority die to apply one of your maneuvers. You can only use this feature once per grenade.

### Volatile Reflexes

## Enhancement Specialist
Those fighters who choose to become Enhancement Specialists learn to apply their technological prowess to their blasters. With their deep understanding of both their weapon and how to manipulate its ammunition on the fly, they can often turn the tides of a battle with a single shot.




### Studied Shooter
_**Enhancement Specialist:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn specialized theory typical for practitioners of the enhancement trade. You gain proficiency in your choice of the Lore or Technology skills. Additionally, you learn your choice of the *encrypted message* or *minor hologram* tech power. Intelligence is your techcasting ability for these powers.  

### Special Ammunition
_**Enhancement Specialist:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn ammunition enhancements that are fueled by amplified shots to unleash special enhanced effects.

#### Ammunition Enhancements
You know two ammunition enhancements of your choice, which are detailed under "Ammunition Enhancements" below, and you earn more at higher levels. Many ammunition enhancements boost an attack in some way. Once per turn when you fire a shot from a blaster as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Ammunition Enhancement options to that shot,

You gain an additional Ammunition Enhancement option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.

Each time you learn new ammunition enhancements, you can also replace one ammunition enhancement you know with a different one.

#### Amplified Shots
You have two amplified shots, which you use to activate your ammunition enhancements. An amplified shot is expended when you use it. When you fire an amplified shot, your weapon is treated as enhanced for overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage. You decide to use the option when the shot hits a creature, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll. You regain all of your amplified shots when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your ammunition enhancements require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___



**Ammunition save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Dexterity modifier



___

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/fVeQ6uW.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:0px;left:40px;width:340px;z-index:1000;' /> --->





### Ammunition Enhancements
The ammunition enhancements are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Carbonite Shot
When this shot strikes its target, shards of carbonite wrap around the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 cold damage, it gains 1 slowed level, and it takes 2d6 kinetic damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the carbonite with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Special Ammunition save DC. Otherwise, the carbonite lasts for 1 minute or until you use this option again.

The cold damage and kinetic damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Coercing Shot
You enhance your shot with chemicals that confuse the target. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.

The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Explosive Shot
You fire a shot set to explode on impact. The shot detonates after your attack. Immediately after the shot hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 fire damage each.

The fire damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Hallucinogen Shot
You enhance your shot with hallucinogenic chemicals. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.

The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Piercing Shot
You enhance your shot with armor-piercing properties. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the shot shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The shot passes through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.

The extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.





#### Quell Shot
You fire a shot enhanced with a debilitating poison. The creature hit by the shot takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.

The poison damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

#### Seeking Shot
You apply a tracing signal to your shot. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The shot flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the shot to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the shot disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the shot, plus an extra 1d6 kinetic damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.

The kinetic damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.

### Enhanced Shot
_**Enhancement Specialist:** 7th level_<br>
You gain the ability to enhance your shots. Whenever you fire an unenhanced shot from a blaster, you can make it enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.

### Redirected Shot
_**Enhancement Specialist:** 10th level_<br>
You learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with an enhanced shot and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.

### Ever-Ready Shot
_**Enhancement Specialist:** 15th level_<br>
Your enhanced ammunition is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Special Ammunition remaining, you regain one use of it.

### Ammunition Upgrades
_**Enhancement Specialist:** 18th level_<br>

On a success, you can immediately choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you that can see you up to your Charisma modifier (no action required, minimum of one). Each creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. This effects ends on a target after 1 minute, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.

This die increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and 1d12 at 17th level.

### The Beauty of Violence
_**Exhibition Specialist:** 18th level_<br>
You've perfected a fighting style that allows you to stylishly dominate the field of battle. When you mark a creature with your In The Spotlight feature, you can enhance it. For the duration of the mark, you gain the following additional benefits:

- You can add half your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) to any weapon attack roll you make against the marked target that doesn't already include that modifier.

Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.





### Hold the Line
_**Mounted Specialist:** 10th level_<br>
You become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target gains 4 slowed levels until the end of the current turn.

You can do so no more than once per turn.




### Strength Before Weakness
_**Praetorian Specialist:** 18th level_<br>
Your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious, and you can immediately take an extra turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

When you complete a long rest, you can replace one totem you know with a different one.

When you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of weapons, armor, or shields equal to the number of totems you know, affixing a different totem to each object. Your totem remains affixed until you finish a long rest, and an object can only bear one totem at a time. You must be wielding or wearing the object to benefit from a totem affixed to it.

Each totem can be invoked to grant an effect. Once you've invoked a totem in this way, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.

#### Totem of the Acklay
This totem evokes the ferocity of an acklay, granting you advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

Additionally, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the totem and force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw by emitting a powerful sound. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is dazed, suffering from the charmed condition, for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its haze. Once you invoke the totem, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. A deaf creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw.

#### Totem of the Loth-wolf
This totem emulates the near etherealness of a loth-wolf, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.

Additionally, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the totem and cause that attack to target a different creature within 30 feet of you (other than the attacker) that you can see, using the same roll. This ability can transfer the attack regardless of the attack's range. 

#### Totem of the Rancor
This totem bestows a resilience reminiscent of a mighty rancor, granting you advantage on saving throws against being poisoned and resistance to poison damage.

Additionally, you can invoke the totem as a bonus action, gaining resistance to energy and kinetic damage for 1 minute.

While restrained by the tentacles, the target takes 2d6 acid damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, tearing free on a success.

Monks of the Kage Order, known as Kage warriors, have mastered fighting in darkness, using that which others fear as a weapon against them. Kage warriors learn tricks to create darkness where none exists, fighting using their intuition rather than relying on sight.

### Darkness Charges
_**Kage Order:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to create a number of small charges that create enhanced darkness. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create two charges. You can create an additional charge at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Your charges can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.

Once per turn, when you would make a weapon attack or unarmed strike, you can instead throw one of your charges. Your charges have a range equal to 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. You can throw a device at a point you can see within range. The charges create a pocket of darkness in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on that point. The darkness spreads around corners. It lasts for 1 minute or until an enhanced source of bright light dispells it.

### Disruptive Shock
_**Kage Order:** 6th level_<br>
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack when you have advantage, or it fails a saving throw against an effect that you control, you can choose to roll a Martial Arts die and deal additional psychic damage equal to the amount rolled.

You can use this feature a<br> number of times equal to your<br> proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain any<br> expended uses when you finish a short or<br> long rest.

### One With Darkness
_**Kage Order:** 11th level_<br>
You have learned to become one with the<br> shadows. When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action<br> to become invisible. You remain<br> invisible until you make an<br> attack, cast a power,<br> otherwise take a hostile<br> action, or are in an area<br> of bright light.




### Opportunist
_**Kage Order:** 17th level_<br>
You can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.

## Kyuzo Order
Monks of the Kyuzo Order turn weapon throwing into a true art form. Inspired by the skill of native kyuzo wielding their war helmets as both shield and weapon, these monks utilize any thrown object they can find to defend themselves and others while they attack enemies from angles both surprising and devastating.

### Intercept
_**Kyuzo Order:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in vibroweapons with<br> the thrown property and they become monk<br> weapons for you. Additionally, when you throw an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient in it, and it uses your Martial Arts die instead of its 1d4. 

Additionally, you've learned to use thrown weapons to intercept projectiles traveling towards your allies. When you are wielding a weapon with which you are<br> proficient, and a creature within your weapon's<br> normal thrown range is hit by a ranged<br> attack, you can use your reaction to throw<br> your weapon to intercept the projectile. When<br> you do so, the damage the creature takes from<br> the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity<br> modifier + your monk level. If the weapon has<br> the returning property, it then returns to your<br> hand.

### Scattering Stance
_**Kyuzo Order:** 6th level_<br>
When you take the Dodge action, until the start of your next turn you gain a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus that you can only use for your Intercept feature. You can only take one reaction per turn.

### Curved Throw
_**Kyuzo Order:** 11th level_<br>
You can curve your throws behind cover.<br> When you make an attack roll with a<br> weapon with the thrown property, you<br> can spend 1 focus point to cause<br> the target to gain no benefit from<br> shields or cover, unless that cover<br> is full cover.




### Relentless Assault
_**Kyuzo Order:** 17th level_<br>
When you make multiple weapon attacks with thrown weapons against the same target on your turn, each attack after the first gains a +1 bonus to its attack roll, cumulatively, to a maximum bonus of +6.

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/5aztMYq.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:21px;right:30px;width:590px;transform:scaleX(-1);z-index:1000' /> --->




## Kro Var Order
Monks of the Kro Var Order—known as shapers—utilize a unique power to bend the four elements to their will, creating effects as small as a floating flame to quakes that sunder the earth.

### Elemental Attunement
_**Kro Var Order:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You gain the ability to bend the elements to your will. As an action, you can manipulate these forces to create one of the following effects of your choice at a space within 10 feet of you:
- Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.
- Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.
- Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1-foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.

This range increases to 30 feet at 11th level and 60 feet at 17th level.

Additionally, as a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 1 focus point to conjure a weapon made of<br> one of the four elements—air, earth, fire, or<br> water—which lasts for 1 minute. Your weapon<br> takes an appearance of your choice, it can only<br> be used by you, and you can't be disarmed of it<br> while you are conscious. You are proficient in this weapon, which counts as a monk weapon for you<br> and uses your Martial Arts die for its damage rolls.<br> You can only have one of these weapons at a time,<br> and if you summon a new one the old one<br> immediately disappears.

#### Air
Your whistling weapon has the returning property, the thrown property with a range of 20/60, and deals sonic damage on a hit. Additionally, when you hit a creature with the weapon, it is deafened until the end of its next turn.

#### Earth
Your earthen weapon takes the form of stone, and deals kinetic damage on a hit. Additionally, when you hit a creature with it, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed back 5 feet. Lastly, while active, you can use Strength instead of Dexterity when determining your AC, as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.




#### Fire
Your flaming weapon sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, deals fire damage, and when you hit a creature with it, the creature takes additional damage equal to half your focus ability modifier (minimum of one).

#### Water
Your watery weapon has the reach property, deals cold damage on a hit, and you can use your focus ability modifier instead of Dexterity or Strength for its attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack, you can instead use your weapon to wet a 5-foot square within your weapon's reach. The affected area is difficult terrain. Each creature who starts its turn in the square or enters it for the first time must make a Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failed save.

### Elemental Adept
_**Kro Var Order:** 6th, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You gain two of the following features. You gain an additional option at 11th and 17th level. 

You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 2 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 2 until you complete a long rest.

#### Burning Ember Flourish
You can use your action to choose an area of flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within 60 feet. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.

***Fireworks.*** The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.

***Smoke.*** Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.

#### Curtain of Unyielding Wind
As an action, you call up a mighty gale, which swirls around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for 10 minutes. The wind deafens both you and other creatures in its area. It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller and hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind. The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you and the attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.

#### Crushing Hand of the Mountain
As an action, you can choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet. A Medium hand made from soil and stone, which lasts for 1 minute, rises in that space and reaches for one Large or smaller creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 kinetic damage and is restrained for the duration. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your focus save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.

#### Hatchling's Flame
As an action, you focus your energy into a torrent of fire that streaks away from you. A line of roaring flame 





30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Patient Bantha Listens
You reach out to the ground beneath you. You can use your bonus action to gain tremorsense with a range of 30 feet and a burrow speed equal to your walking speed for up to 1 minute. Your movement leaves behind a tunnel that remains for as long as this ability is active, after which it collapses.

#### Rush of the Shyrack
As an action, you form a line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that blasts from you in a direction you choose for one minute or until you lose concentration or dismiss the effect (no action required). Each Large or smaller creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.

#### Shape the Raincloud
You can use your action pull water from air, and return it to the atmosphere. In an open container, you can create up to 20 gallons of drinkable water. You may also produce a rain that falls within a 30-foot cube and extinguishes open-air flames. You can destroy the same amount of water in an open container, or destroy a 30-foot cube of fog.

#### Swarming Ice Rabbit
As an action, you can cause a flurry of ice crystals to erupt from a point you can see within 90 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 cold damage, and gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed.

### Elemental Master
_**Kro Var Order:** 11th and 17th level_<br>
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features. You gain an additional option at 17th level.

You can use these features a combined number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, as shown in the monk table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 3 focus points to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 3 until you complete a long rest.




#### Earth Reaches for Sky
_**Prerequisite:** Crushing Hand of the Mountain_ or _Patient Bantha Listens_<br>
As an action, you can choose a point you can see on the ground within 120 feet. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

#### Ride the Wind
_**Prerequisite:** Curtain of Unyielding Wind_ or _Rush of the Shyrack_<br>
As an action, you can gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed for 10 minutes. You can hover while this technique is active, but when it ends, you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.

#### River of Hungry Flame
_**Prerequisite:** Burning Ember Flourish_ or _Hatchling's Flame_<br>
As an action, you can create a wall of fire on a solid surface within 120 feet. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall, chosen by you when you use this feature, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side of the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

#### Shape the Flowing River
_**Prerequisite:** Shape the Rainclud_ or _Swarming Ice Rabbit_<br>
As an action, you can control any freestanding water within 300 feet of you inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you use this feature. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller creatures struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of being knocked prone. The water level remains elevated until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. 





***Part Water.*** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the feature's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the feature ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the feature's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the feature ends or you choose a different effect.

***Whirlpool.*** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your feature save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 kinetic damage and is caught in the vortex until the feature ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 kinetic damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.

### Elemental Paragon
_**Kro Var Order:** 17th level_<br>
You gain one of the following features. 

Once you've used the chosen feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

A creature takes 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center of the cube.

A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect gains 1 slowed level until the start of your next turn.

At the start of each of your turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the benefits of this feature until the start of your next turn, to a maximum duration of 1 minute. This effect ends immediately if you are incapacitated or die.



#### Embodiment of Earth
_**Prerequisite:** Earth Reaches for Sky_<br>
As an action, you cause rock to envelop you, granting the following benefits until the start of your next turn:
- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.
- You can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without spending extra movement. You can move through solid earth or stone as if it was air without destabilizing it, but you can't end your movement there.

### Forredari Stance
_**Teras Kasi Order:** 3rd level_<br>
Your honed focus allows you to enter a stance of mental fortification and power. You can use your bonus action to enter this stance. When you do so, you unleash a flurry of blows on creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon's normal damage.

This stance lasts for 1 minute. While you are in this stance, you gain the following benefits:

- **Charging Wampa.** Once per round, when you are forced to make a saving throw against a force power, your movement speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.
- **Nexu Grin.** When a creature you can see within 10 feet of you casts a force power that requires a force attack roll against you or an an allied creature, you can use your reaction and expend 1 focus point to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack misses, and the higher of the two d20 rolls would also miss, the creature cannot cast that force power again until it completes a short or long rest.
- **Screaming Squill.** Once per turn, when you hit a creature that is concentrating on a force power and it makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, the DC for the check equals your focus save DC, unless the DC for the Constitution saving throw would be higher.

These effects end early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 focus point to use it. When you do so, your maximum focus points are reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest.

### Matter Over Mind

You tap into the greater power of your focus. While both your Forredari Stance and your Steel Hands Form are active, you gain the following benefits:

- **Aryx Slash.** Once on each of your turns, when you hit a target with an unarmed strike or monk weapon, you can roll a Martial Arts die and deal additional psychic damage equal to the amount rolled.
- **Piercing Gaze.** When you would make an Insight check against a creature you know to wield the Force, you can use your focus ability modifier for the roll, and you are considered to have expertise in the Insight skill. If you would already have expertise in the check, you instead have advantage on the roll. 

### Spitting Rawl
_**Teras Kasi Order:** 17th level_<br>
You have learned to harness your strikes in a blistering fury. On your turn, when a creature takes damage from you three times, you can make up to three additional unarmed strikes against the creature (no action required). The first additional unarmed strike costs 1 focus point and deals 1d12 additional psychic damage on a hit, and each unarmed strike after the first costs 1 additional focus point and deals 1d12 additional psychic damage on a hit, cumulatively.

## Trickster Order
Monks of the Trickster Order embody the archetypal role of the "trickster"— one who seemingly bumbles their way into good fortune. They employ a unique fighting style composed of slips, trips, and falls to confuse and frustrate their enemies to no end. Whether your movements are actual foibles on your part or calculated strokes, they will surely leave others guessing long after your time is past.

You can move in sudden, swaying ways. You gain the following benefits.

***Leap to Your Feet.*** When you're prone, you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

### Luck of the Fool

- When you would make an unarmed strike<br> using your Martial Arts bonus action<br> or as a part of<br> your<br> Flurry of Blows, you can instead attack with a Whills weapon you are wielding. You roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your Whills weapon when attacking in this way. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.
- When you would make a ranged weapon attack with a Whills weapon, you can instead reload the weapon.

### The Force is With You

- You can use your Stunning Strike feature when you hit with a ranged weapon attack while you are wielding a Whills weapon. 
- You can spend up to 3 focus points to reduce partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter). If you reduce the target below one-quarter cover, you ignore cover bonuses entirely. At 17th level, you can spend 3 focus points to ignore total cover, as long as your target is not hidden from you. 
- When you hit a creature with a Whills weapon, that creature has disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you until the start of your next turn.

### Articulate Authority
_**Bolstering Practice:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
When you use your Cunning Action feature to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide actions, a number of friendly creatures up to your Charisma modifier within 30 feet of you who can hear you and who can understand you can use their reaction to gain an effect, determined by the action you took:
- **Dash:** The creature can move up to half their speed. They must end this movement within 30 feet of you.

- **Hide:** The creature has advantage on the first attack roll they make before the end of their next turn against a creature you successfully hide from.

#### Reaffirming Strike
You use the authority your attacks carry to help your ally focus on the task at hand. Choose a creature within 60 feet of you who can see or hear you and that is currently charmed or frightened by the creature you would deal Sneak Attack damage to. The condition immediately ends on that creature.

### Open Opportunity
_**Bolstering Practice:** 9th level_<br>
Once per turn, when you take the Attack action and hit a creature without applying your Sneak Attack damage to it, you can forgo your Sneak Attack damage for the turn and use your bonus action to throw the creature off balance. The next ally to hit that creature before the start of your next turn may add your Sneak Attack dice to the damage of their attack. 

### Ambush Tactics
_**Bolstering Practice:** 13th level_<br>
When attempting to move stealthily as a group, you may choose a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier. Those creatures may add their proficiency to any Dexterity (Stealth) checks they make as long as they remain within 60 feet of you and they do not already add their proficiency bonus.

Additionally, each ally other than you that surprises a creature and hits it with an attack on their first turn in combat rolls two dice equal to the size of your Sneak Attack dice, dealing additional damage of the same type to the creature. 

### Squad Goals

## Disabling Practice
Those operatives who choose the Disabling Practice utilize a variety of pushes, pulls, weight shifts, and joint locks to immobilize their opponent. They use these techniques to manipulate their opponent, moving them across the battlefield before incapacitating them.

_**Disabling Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn how to discourage, debilitate, and harm your enemies. You gain the following benefits while you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a medium or heavy shield:
- Your damage die for your unarmed strikes and natural weapons increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8), and you can apply your Sneak Attack damage when you hit with an unarmed strike even if it doesn't have the finesse property.
- You don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if the target of your Sneak Attack is a creature grappled by you. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.
- You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling.

### Skilled Grappler
_**Disabling Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn a number of grappling techniques to subdue your opponents. When you hit a creature grappled by you with an unarmed strike and deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a grappling technique.

___



**Grapple Technique save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier



___

#### Constrict
You attempt to choke the target into unconsciousness. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your following turn.  

If you maintain this technique for 1 minute,<br> the target falls unconscious for 1 hour. Droids and constructs can not be knocked unconscious in this<br> way.

#### Disarm

### Human Shield

You learn to manipulate the body of a grappled target to make attacks against you more difficult to land. Moving a grappled creature the same size as you or smaller no longer halves your speed, and when a creature grappled by you would grant you half cover, you instead have three-quarters cover. Additionally, when you are hit by an attack while grappling a creature, you can use your reaction to force that attack to instead hit the grappled creature.

### Kiss the Wall
_**Disabling Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You can use your surroundings to further punish the target of your grapple. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a Sneak Attack damage die for an unarmed strike you make against a creature grappled by you, you can treat the result of the die as a 3.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

You can flourish your weapon in an intimidating or charming manner. As an action, you can cause one creature within 60 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, the target is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. 



### Ricochet Shot
_**Gunslinger Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You learn how to work all the angles. Once per turn, when you take the Attack action and miss with a ranged weapon attack, you can repeat the attack against a different target within 10 feet of the original target (no action required).

You learn to perform miracles with just a blaster and some nerve. On your first turn in combat, if you aren't surprised, you can use your action to attack creatures that have not yet acted.

Once you've used this feature, you must<br> complete a short or long rest before you<br> can use it again.

On a successful save, your AC instead increases by the lower amount.

#### Disarming Strike

Your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.




If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a power, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.

If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

### Elegant Maneuver
_**Ruffian Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.

Create your tracker droid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have astrotech's implements in order to create your droid.

In addition to its traits and features, your tracker droid companion gains an additional benefit while it is bonded to you:
- Your tracker droid gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each droid trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of tracker droid traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Lastly, when you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher that would affect only one target, and your tracker droid companion is bonded and within 10 feet of you or your target, your tracker droid companion can use its reaction to increase the level at which you are casting your power by 1.

### Sabotage
_**Saboteur Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You gain the ability to sabotage a tech power in the process of being cast. When a hostile creature casts a tech power, and you are the target of the tech power or within its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.

On a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and the caster takes 1d6 lightning damage per level of the power it was casting. Additionally, on a failed save, the caster's tech focus used to cast the tech power is overloaded and can't be used to cast tech powers for 1 minute. 

At the end of each of the caster's turns, it can repeat the Intelligence saving throw. On a success, it can use the tech focus to cast tech powers again.

At your DM's discretion, you may be able to use this feature on other pacs, stims, or adrenals, most likely involving an ability check to succeed.

### Self-Sustain
_**Sawbones Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You have advantage on death saving throws.

Additionally, when you are stabilized, you regain 1 hit point. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

You gain proficiency in all blasters with the burst or rapid property that lack the two-handed property. Additionally, when a creature fails a saving throw against the burst or rapid property of a weapon you control and with which you are proficient, you can apply your Sneak Attack damage to one creature dealt damage in this way as long as that creature didn't have advantage on the save.

When you reach 9th level in this class, when multiple creatures fail a saving throw against the burst property of a weapon you control and with which you are proficient, you can divide your Sneak Attack dice amongst the targets as you see fit.

As an action, you can use one of your doses to coat one vibroweapon, one slug cartridge, or one wrist launcher dart. A creature hit by the coated weapon must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), taking 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier poison damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

The quantity and damage of your doses increases at higher levels, to three and 2d4 at 5th level, four and 3d4 at 9th level, five and 4d4 at 13th level, and six and 5d4 at 17th level.

### One With the Dark
_**Shadow Killer Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You learn to partially enter the spirit realm. As an action, you can become invisible as an enhanced effect, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Archaic Diagnostics
_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
When you analyze a hostile creature, you can use maneuvers that require a weapon attack when you cast a force power that requires a force attack and you can use maneuvers that require a hit with a weapon attack when a creature fails a saving throw against a force power you cast.

### Force Carving
_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 6th level_<br>
You have unlocked more control over the Force, allowing you to choose wisely who it affects. When you cast a force power that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the power's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the power, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.





### Psychometric Analysis
_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 9th level_<br>
Your strength in the Force and your ability to read the objects around you intensifies. You can use your Critical Analysis to analyze an object of Huge size or smaller that you can see within range. When you do so, you learn whether or not the object is enhanced, cursed, and how old it is. 

Additionally, you can end your Critical Analysis on the object (no action required) to ask it a single question and receive an answer, usually in the form of an auditory or visual hallucination. For example, touching the rusted, broken remains of a lightsaber and asking how it got there may result in a brief vision of a disgruntled Jedi Knight casting it to the ground on that spot. An object “questioned” in this way can only provide information relating to its past. The GM has the final say on what objects can be questioned, and to what extent.

You can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Knowledge is Power
_**Archaeologist Pursuit:** 17th level_<br>
You gain the ability to steal the knowledge of how to cast a power from another forcecaster. When a hostile creature casts a force power that affects a friendly creature within range of your Critical Analysis feature, and you use your reaction target that friendly creature with your Critical Analysis feature, you can force the creature casting the power to make a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw (your choice) against your universal force save DC. On a successful save, the power is cast as normal.

On a failed save, you negate the power's effects, and you steal the knowledge of that power if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast. For the next 8 hours, you know the power and can cast it using your force points. The creature cannot cast that power again until the 8 hours have passed.

Once you've used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Archaeologist Discoveries
When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your studies into historical civilations. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order. 

#### Archive Research
Your expeditions have turned up a bevy of knowledge on the force. You learn three at-will force powers of your choice, which don't count against your number of force powers known.

#### Localized Survey
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_<br>
Your affinity for the force allows you to key in to the recent past of an area you enter. When you would expend a use of your Psychometric Analysis, you can instead choose to target your immediate vicinity (up to a 50-foot cube) and investigate for at least 1 minute. For each minute you investigate, you see visions of recent events in the area going back a number of days equal to your scholar level, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. 

You can investigate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your scholar level and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were concentrating on a power. 

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

You may now cast force powers at 4th-level twice between rests. 

#### Telekinetic Ministrations
_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_<br>
You can cast the *telekinesis* force power at 5th level without spending force points.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

#### The Years and the Mileage
Your archaeological studies have taken you all across the galaxy. While you are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you can use your universal forcecasting ability instead of Wisdom when making Insight or Survival checks.

#### Tomb of the Ancients
_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_<br>
As a reaction when you take damage, you can entomb yourself in the Force until the end of your next turn. For the duration, you have resistance to the triggering damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your universal forcecasting ability modifier + your scholar level to potentially absorb the attack, and your speed is reduced to 0.

When you cast a tech power that affects an area and requires a saving throw, and you are inside that power's area, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If you end this movement outside the area affected by the tech power, you do not have to make a saving throw to avoid its effects. 

#### Intelligence Core Override
_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_<br>
You can cast the *override interface* tech power at 5th level without spending tech points. 

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

#### Resource Appropriation
_**Prerequisite:** 11th level_<br>
If you reduce the target of your Critical Analysis feature to 0 hit points, and it has tech point remaining, you may choose to gain any tech points it had remaining. Your current tech points cannot exceed your tech point maximum.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### Skillful Casting
When you hit a creature with an at-will tech power that requires an attack roll, you may treat that attack roll as a weapon attack for the purpose of using maneuvers.

#### Sleeper Program
Whenever you cast a tech power with a casting time of 1 action, you can choose to delay the power's activation up to a minute. When you do so, you cast the power as normal, but holds its energy for the duration of the delay. Holding onto the power's effect requires concentration. If your concentration is broken before the delay ends, the power dissipates without taking effect. You can use your reaction to activate the power at any time.

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses  when you finish a long rest.

Your beast's reflexes and agility allow it to move with a burst of speed. When your beast moves on its turn in combat, it can double its speed until the end of the turn. Once its used this feature, it can't use it again until it moves 0 feet on one of its turns.

### Feral Ferocity

## Artillerist Technique



Some scouts choose to navigate around defenses, while others choose to go through them. Followers of the Artillerist Technique learn to exert greater control of their tech powers, causing delayed—and often empowered—effects.

### Modular Munitions
_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
When you cast a tech power, rather than having it take effect instantly, you can choose to delay the effect to occur on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). When you do so, any creature that leaves the affected area of your tech power is unaffected when the tech power occurs. If the power would only target one creature, and that creature moves from the space it was in when you cast the power, the tech power automatically misses if it would call for an attack roll, as if you had rolled a 1 on the attack, and the creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw against the power if it calls for a saving throw, as if it had rolled a 20 on the save.

Additionally, when you cast a tech power and choose to delay it in this way, and that tech power would deal damage, you can apply one of the following additional empowerment effects:
- **Flashbang**: Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded and deafened until the start of your next turn.
- **Mire:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain one slowed level until the start of your next turn.
- **Psyche:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the start of your next turn.

If an empowerment effect calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your tech save DC.

You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 tech point to use it. When you do so, your maximum tech points are reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest.

### Mark of the Artillerist
_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd and 11th level_<br>
You can now use your Ranger's Quarry feature on a 10-foot cube area within 60 feet of you that you can see. You can treat any creatures inside this cube as if they are the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature, and when a creature is hit by a tech attack or fails a saving throw against a tech power you cast that deals damage, you can apply your Ranger's Quarry damage to that creature.

At 11th level, you can now use your Ranger's Quarry feature on a 15-foot cube area, instead of a 10-foot cube.



### Sundered Defenses
_**Artillerist Technique:** 7th level_<br>
Your precise bombardments make even the most hardened defenses crumble. When you cast a power that calls for a tech attack or a Dexterity saving throw, it reduces partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter) against creatures affected by it. If an affected creature has one-quarter cover, your power ignores it entirely.

### Target Masking
_**Artillerist Technique:** 11th level_<br>
You are familiar with various turrets and defensive emplacements, and their operation. 

As a bonus action, you can activate a masking effect to confuse the targeting of constructs for 1 minute. Any construct who targets you with an attack, a harmful power, or a hostile action must first make a Wisdom saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, the construct must choose a new target or lose the attack or power. This power doesn't protect you from area effects.

You can use this feature a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Master of Ordnance
_**Artillerist Technique:** 15th level_<br>
You can now expend two uses of your Modular Munitions feature when you cast a tech power to apply two empowerment effects, instead of only one. Additionally, you gain three additional empowerment effects:
- **Confusion:** Each creature damaged by this power must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, on its next turn, a creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.
- **Knockout:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Static:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become shocked until the start of your next turn.

Additionally,<br> when you would<br> spend 1 tech point<br> to apply an empowerment<br> effect, it no longer<br> reduces your<br> maximum tech<br> points.

_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in artillerist's implements.

### Turret Companion
_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to apply your knowledge to construct and bond with your own portable turret.

Create your turret companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have artillerist's implements in order to create your turret.

In addition to its traits and features, your turret companion gains additional benefits while it is bonded to you:
- Your turret is a valid target of the *tracker droid interface* tech power.
- Your turret gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each turret trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is<br> reduced by 1. Over the course of a long<br> rest, you can install, replace, or remove a<br> number of turret traits equal to half<br> your Intelligence modifier (rounded<br> up, minimum of one).
- When you would make a weapon<br> attack, you can let your turret make<br> a weapon attack instead.

Lastly, while your turret<br> is bonded, within 10 feet<br> of you, and the target of<br> your *tracker droid interface*<br> tech power, when you cast a<br> tech power with a range of 5<br> feet or greater, you can cast it as if<br> you were in your turret's space, and<br> the range increases to 10 feet if it<br> isn't greater.

Both the range and radius<br> increase to 30 feet at 11th level,<br> and 60 feet at 17th level.



### Mark of the Artillerist
_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
Once per round, when your turret deals damage to the target of your Ranger's Quarry, you can roll your Ranger's Quarry die and add it to the damage roll.

### Crisis Management
_**Artillerist Technique:** 7th level_<br>
While you can see your turret, it can add half its proficiency bonus to any saving throws it makes that doesn't already include it.

### Double Up
_**Artillerist Technique:** 11th level_<br>
When you deal damage to a creature with a weapon or tech power, your turret has advantage on the next attack roll it makes against the creature or it has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against an effect your turret controls before the start of your next turn. When your turret deals damage to a creature, you have advantage on your next attack roll against the creature or it has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against an effect you control before the start of your next turn.

### Battlefront
_**Artillerist Technique:** 15th level_<br>
When you use your Combat Tech feature, both you and your turret can each make one weapon attack as part of the same bonus action.

## Deadeye Technique



Some scouts become legends written in blaster burns. Followers of the Deadeye Technique perfect the art of the blaster shot and utilize their incredible focus to make shots that most would deem impossible. When everything depends on one shot, you want a Deadeye pulling the trigger.

#### Maneuvers Known
You learn two maneuvers of your choice, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the Deadeye Superiority table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.

Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

#### Superiority Dice
You have two superiority dice, which are d4s, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Superiority Dice Quantity column of the Deadeye Superiority table.

Your maneuver ability varies based on the type of the maneuver you use. You use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for physical maneuvers (your choice), Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for mental maneuvers (your choice), and an ability of your choice for general maneuvers. You use this ability whenever a maneuver refers to your maneuver ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a maneuver you use.

### Shoot First
_**Deadeye Technique:** 11th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You have learned that the person who shoots first is often the one who walks out alive. When you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature that has not yet acted during your first turn in combat and you have advantage on the roll, you can reroll one of the dice once. Additionally, on a hit, you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type as the weapon. This damage increases to 1d10 at 13th level and 1d12 at 17th level.

If your attack hits, either impose disadvantage on the enemy creature's opportunity attack roll or grant advantage to any allies making the saving throw.





## Illusionist Technique
Among the galaxy you may find the various infiltrators and agents who make ample use of holographic technology to get themselves in and out of danger. Followers of the Illusionist Technique make use of this holographic technology to give themselves an illusory edge in combat.

### Holographic Decoy
_**Illusionist Technique:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
As an action, you can create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 10 minutes, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a power). The decoy appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. The decoy is purely visual. If anything passes through it, it is revealed to be an illusion. For the duration, you can cast tech powers as though you were in the decoy's space. Both your decoy and the target of your tech power must be within your line of sight.

You can use your bonus action to cause the decoy to move up to 30 feet. As your decoy changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the decoy. If your decoy is ever more than 120 feet away from you, it immediately disappears.

Additionally, when both you and your decoy are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the decoy, but is not aware it is an illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.

A creature that uses its action to examine your decoy can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

When a creature discerns the nature of an illusion you have created using a tech power or class feature while within 5 feet of it, you can dispel the illusion (no action required) to have the creature take energy damage equal to 1d10 + half your scout level. 

### Quick Escape
_**Illusionist Technique:** 11th level_<br>

### Improved Decoys
_**Illusionist Technique:** 15th level_<br>
You can create up to four duplicates of yourself, instead of one, when you use your Holographic Decoy feature. When you use your bonus action to move a decoy, you can move any number of them with the same bonus action.

Once within the next 10 minutes, each creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, as determined when you use this feature. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Emergency Planning die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Emergency Planning die is rolled, it is lost.

A creature can have only one Emergency Planning die at a time.

_**Mechanist Technique:** 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You can use your ingenuity to bolster yourself or an ally. As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature:
- For 10 minutes, the creature can roll a d3 whenever making an attack roll or an ability check and add the number rolled to the d20 roll. Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can't receive it again until it finishes a short or long rest.
- Roll a d4. The creature regains a number of tech points equal to the result. Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can't receive it again until it finishes a long rest.

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### High Voltage
_**Mechanist Technique:** 11th level_<br>
You are used to working with electronics and have learned to increase their potency, while becoming inured to their dangers. You gain resistance to ion and lightning damage.

Additionally, whenever you deal ion damage to a creature, you can spend a tech point to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Command Droid
_**Mechanist Technique:** 15th level_<br>
You can reprogram a droid and bring it under your control. As an action, you can touch one droid that you can see that is the target of your Ranger's Quarry. That creature must make a Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again for 24 hours. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.

Intelligent droids are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/UIwaVgQ.png' style='position:absolute;transform:scaleX(1);bottom:0px;left:5px;width:500px;z-index:1000' /> --->






## Mechanist Technique (Companion)



Some scouts are peerless inventors, skilled at working with droids and other forms of technology. Followers of the Mechanist Technique utilize the assistance of a tracker droid companion to make up for the weakness of organics with the strength and purity of their creations.

### Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency in astrotech’s implements.

### Improved Techcasting
_**Mechanist Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
Your command of techcasting improves.

#### Improved Tech Powers Known
You know 7 tech powers of your choice, instead of 5, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

#### Improved Tech Points
You have a number of tech points equal to one and a half times your scout level, instead of your scout level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Improved Max Power Level
Your Max Power Level becomes 2nd, instead of 1st, and it increases at higher levels, as shown in the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table.

You may only cast tech powers at 5th, 6th, and 7th-level once, instead of 4th and 5th. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

### Tracker Droid Companion
_**Mechanist Technique:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own tracker droid companion.

Create your tracker droid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have astrotech's implements in order to create your droid.

In addition to its traits and features, your tracker droid companion gains an additional benefit while it is bonded to you:
- Your tracker droid gains two additional traits. It<br> gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each droid trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of droid traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/2DWzzeB.png' style='position:absolute;transform:scaleX(1);bottom:-40px;right:-90px;width:700px;z-index:1000' /> --->




Lastly, while your tracker droid companion is bonded and within 10 feet of you, you can use your action to learn the location of any droid or construct, tech focus, tech power or enhanced item within 60 feet of you or your tracker droid that isn't behind total cover. When you sense a tech power in this way, you learn what the power is. At 11th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 30 feet of you or your target to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 60 feet. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Mark of the Mechanist
_**Mechanist Technique:** 7th level_<br>
As a bonus action, you can cause the target of your Ranger's Quarry to emit an ion pulse, as long as the target is within 60 feet of you. The target, and any creatures within 5 feet of it, must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, roll your Ranger's Quarry die; each creature takes ion damage equal to the amount rolled.

### High Voltage
_**Mechanist Technique:** 11th level_<br>
You are used to working with electronics and have learned to increase their potency, while becoming inured to their dangers. You gain resistance to ion and lightning damage.

Additionally, whenever you deal ion damage to a creature, you can spend a tech point to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Command Droid
_**Mechanist Technique:** 15th level_<br>
You can reprogram a droid and bring it under your control. As an action, you can touch one droid that you can see that is the target of your Ranger's Quarry.

If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.

Intelligent droids are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

## Predator Technique
Some scouts work in solitude, while others prefer the strength of a group. Followers of the Predator Technique find power lies with the pack; they distract their prey, while their allies go for the kill.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Predator Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in heavy armor.

### Hunting Party
_**Predator Technique:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack.

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.




### Mark of the Predator
_**Predator Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
If the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature can see you, a number of friendly creatures you choose up to your Intelligence modifier have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide from it.

### Predator's Resolve
_**Predator Technique:** 7th level_<br>
You can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws.
- At the start of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one).
- When you use your Hunting Party feature and the target of the attack is your Ranger's Quarry, your ally gains a bonus to damage on the attack equal to your Ranger's Quarry Damage Die.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Prey on the Weak
_**Predator Technique:** 11th level_<br>
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, and the creature is below its hit point maximum, the next attack roll made against that creature before the end of your next turn by someone other than you has advantage.

### On the Hunt
_**Predator Technique:** 15th level_<br>
When you use your Predator's Resolve feature, a number of friendly creatures you choose up to your Intelligence modifier that you can see within 30 feet of you also gain the benefits of the feature.

## Teleportation Technique
Whether through experimentation or discovery of an ancient technology, followers of the Teleportation Technique have learned to create brief teleportation portals, allowing them to ;maneuver and attack both quickly and unpredictably throughout the battlefield.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in tinker's implements.

### Personal Teleporter
_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th, and 20th level_<br>
You can use portable teleporters as a bonus action, instead of an action. 

Additionally, while you are wielding a tech focus, you can use your bonus action to create a pair of linked portals: one portal appears in a space within 5 feet of you, and the other portal appears in an unoccupied space you can see up to 30 feet away. These portals last until the start of your next turn, and they are large enough to accommodate Medium and smaller creatures and objects. Portals take the appearance of an elongated, shimmering mirror, and looking through a portal, a creature can see through the linked portal as if looking through a window. A creature or object who passes through a portal immediately appears in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal. You can use your reaction to end your portals early. If a creature is partially within your portals, it is shunted back to the space it previously occupied and it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your a tech save DC. On a failed save, it takes energy damage equal to your scout level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest. At the beginning of each of your turns while you have a pair of portals active, you can expend a use of this feature to extend the duration of the portals until the start of your next turn (no action required). The distance at which you can create portals increases at higher levels. It increases to 60 feet at 5th level, 90 feet at 9th level, 150 feet at 13th level, 300 feet at 17th level, and 1,000 feet at 20th level.

### Mark of the Teleporter
_**Teleportation Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
On your turn, when you deal damage to the target of your Ranger's Quarry, and either you, your weapon, or the source of your damage have passed through your portals on this turn, when you roll below half the maximum on a damage die, you can treat the roll as if you'd rolled half the maximum on the damage die. You can only affect a number of dice up to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) in this way.




### Residual Warp
_**Teleportation Technique:** 7th level_<br>
When you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place your portal in a place you've visited in the last 10 minutes, provided you can remember it, as opposed to a place you can see. That place must still be within range of your teleporter.

### Quantum Entanglement
_**Teleportation Technique:** 11th level_<br>
When you use your Personal Teleporter feature, you can place the portal that you would normally place within 5 feet of you in a place you can see within your Personal Teleporter's range. If that space is occupied by a Huge or smaller creature or a Medium or smaller unsecured object, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC. An object automatically fails this saving throw, and a creature can choose to fail. On a failed save, a Medium or smaller creature or object falls through the portal, immediately appearing in a space within 5 feet of the linked portal and falling prone. A Large or Huge creature instead falls prone without moving.

### Reprisal
_**Teleportation Technique:** 15th level_<br>
When you would be affected by a weapon or tech power that requires a Dexterity saving throw or attack roll and would affect only you, you can use your reaction to instantaneously create a pair of portals to redirect that power to another target within 30 feet. If the weapon or power required a melee or ranged attack roll, make a melee or ranged tech attack roll against the new target, as appropriate. If it required a Dexterity saving throw, the new target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your tech save DC.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Triage Technique
With every conflict comes death and destruction. Followers of the Triage Technique excel at keeping their comrades in the fight with quick thinking and fast-acting medicine.

### Triage Training
_**Triage Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill. 

Additionally, when you would use your action to make an ability check to stabilize a creature, expend a use of a traumakit, or use a medpac, you can instead use your bonus action.

### Mark of Triage 
_**Triage Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn new ways to use your Ranger's Quarry. 
- While a hostile creature is the target of your Ranger's Quarry, you always know any conditions it is suffering from, and you know at roughly what percentage its current hit points is relative to its maximum. Additionally, if the target is within 60 feet of you, when it is forced to make a Constitution saving throw, you can use your reaction to force it to make the roll with disadvantage. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
- While a friendly creature is the target of your Ranger's Quarry, you have advantage on Wisdom (Medicine) checks made to stabilize it. Additionally, if the target is within 60 feet of you, you can use your bonus action and roll your Ranger's Quarry and either restore hit points equal to the amount rolled, or grant temporary hit points equal to the amount rolled. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.

### Double Dose
_**Triage Technique:** 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
Your application of medicine does not interfere with your own ability to recover from injuries. When you restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to another creature with a tech power or class feature, you recover the same amount of hit points or gain the same number of temporary hit points. 

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Experimental Infusion
_**Triage Technique:** 11th level_<br>
When you target a creature with your Ranger's Quarry, you can grant one of the following additional effects of your choice:
- ***Adrenaline/Tranquilizer.*** The creature's movement speed is doubled until the end of its next turn. Alternatively, it gains a level of slowed until the end of its next turn.




- ***Focus/Dizziness.*** The creature has either advantage or disadvantage (your choice) on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next minute.
- ***Toughen/Weaken.*** The creature gains temporary hit points equal to your scout level, which last for 1 minute. Alternatively, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failure, it takes psychic damage equal to your scout level and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.

You can use each feature once. You regain any expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Cure-All
_**Triage Technique:** 15th level_<br>
Your healing becomes even more potent. When you restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature as a bonus action using your Mark of Triage feature, you can also end one of the following conditions afflicting it: blinded, deafened, diseased, paralyzed, or poisoned.

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/i9YaACg.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:23px;right:30px;width:412px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)'/> --->






## Path of Aggression



From the murky depths of the dark side comes seething fury. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Aggression charge their weapon with lightning, culminating in a massive discharge that can ravage their opponents.

### Voltaic Slash
_**Path of Aggression:** 3rd level_<br>
Starting when you choose this calling at 3rd level, you learn the *lightning charge* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and when you deal lightning damage with the *lightning charge* force power, you deal additional lightning damage equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) if it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Thunderous Momentum
_**Path of Aggression:** 3rd level_<br>
Your stride becomes nigh unbreakable. You are immune to the shocked condition, and each slowed level only reduces your speed by 5 feet, unless it would reduce your speed to 0.



### Entropic Rush
_**Path of Aggression:** 7th level_<br>
You've learned to move with speed and precision, discharging your lightning in a massive burst. When you move at least half your speed before casting *lightning charge*, you make the attack roll with advantage. Additionally, on a hit, the lightning can leap a second time, to a third creature within range or back to the first creature.

### Living Current
_**Path of Aggression:** 13th level_<br>
You've learned to channel the damage done to you to enhance your strikes. The first time you deal damage on your turn, if you took damage since the start of your last turn, you can deal additional lightning damage equal to your Kinetic Combat die + half the amount of damage taken.

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Retaliatory Strike
_**Path of Aggression:** 18th level_<br>
When a creature hits you with an attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to cast the *lightning charge* force power, targeting them.

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/DSR5EWH.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:14px;left:66px;width:730px;;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' /> --->





## Path of Communion
Those who master the Force can transcend death, persisting beyond their natural experation. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Communion bond with a Force ghost, developing a symbiotic relationship which alters the way they perceive their surroundings.

### Mystical Connection
_**Path of Communion:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *feedback* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use the Double Strike Force-Empowered Self option when you cast it as your action and the target fails its saving throw. Finally, when you deal psychic damage with the *feedback* force power, you deal additional psychic damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) if it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Symbiot Spirit
_**Path of Communion:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You attract the attention of the spirit of a Force ghost. Over the course of one hour, you can attune to the spirit, forging a lasting connection. While attuned to a spirit, you gain the following benefits:
- Your spirit is always audible and visible to you. Your spirit can choose to make itself audible and visible or inaudible and invisible to other creatures (no action required), but it is always visible to beings with truesight.
- Your spirit can not interact with the corporeal world, but it is also not impeded by unenhanced walls or barriers.
- Your spirit acts independently of you, and it only obeys your commands if it chooses to. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. Your spirit can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
- While your spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can telepathically communicate with it. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your spirit's vision and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
- When you cast a force power with a range of touch, your spirit can deliver the power as if it had cast it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the power when you cast it. If the power requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

You can only attune to one spirit at a time. If you attempt to attune to another spirit, you immediately break the bond with your current spirit.

> #### Generating Your Spirit
> Your spirit might be the ghost of a benevolent Jedi, discovered in the ruins of a Jedi temple, or a powerful Sith spirit lingering in an ancient artifact. It might be the spirit of a Nightsister sorceress, or a paragon of a long-forgotten monastic order. Work with your GM to determine the nature of your spirit.




Additionally, your spirit can briefly interact with the physical world. When you would make a melee attack, your spirit can deliver the attack as if it had made it. Your spirit must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the attack. It uses your modifiers for the attack and damage rolls. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Invasive Presence
_**Path of Communion:** 7th level_<br>
Your spirit can invade another creature's being. As an action, your spirit can touch a creature within 5 feet of it, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. 

On a failed save, your spirit moves into that creatures space, inhabiting its body, for 1 minute. The affected creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes each turn. At the end of each its turns, the creature repeats this save. On a success, it repels the spirit from its body, and it becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Ethereal Vision
_**Path of Communion:** 13th level_<br>
You and your guiding spirit both gain truesight out to 60 feet as long as your spirit is within 100 feet of you.

Additionally, when you use your action to see through your spirit's senses, you are no longer deaf and blind with regard to your own senses, able to comprehend what happens in both perspectives simultaneously.

### Assuming Direct Control
_**Path of Communion:** 18th level_<br>
When a creature fails its saving throw against your Invasive Presence feature, the target becomes charmed by you for as long as Invasive Presence is active.

While the target is charmed, you and your spirit have a telepathic link with it as long as you are within 100 feet of it. You and your spirit can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.





## Path of Ethereality
In the distant reaches of the galaxy obscure knowledge and forgotten secrets of the Force can sometimes be found. While other Force-sensitive may find themselves touched by this secret knowledge of the Force, those sentinels who follow the Path of Ethereality instead find themselves grabbed. Held onto by mysterious aspects of the Force that refuse to let go, these sentinels find themselves able to manipulate the universe around them.

### Aberrant Resilience
_**Path of Ethereality:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *resistance* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, this power no longer requires concentration for you when you target yourself with it.




### Force-Empowered Kinesis
_**Path of Ethereality:** 3rd level_<br>
Your connection to the Force allows you to briefly become incorporeal. When you use a Force-Empowered Self option, until the end of your turn, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain. If you end this movement inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take true damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. 

### Out of Touch
_**Path of Ethereality:** 7th level_<br>
As an action, you can step out of sync with the rest of the universe for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, roll a d20. If you roll 11 or higher, you and everything your are wearing or carrying are completely invisible to all beings, except for those with truesight. On a roll of 10 or lower, you instead appear as an indistinguishably blurred form roughly your normal height and weight, though a being with truesight sees you normally. Regardless of your appearance, for the duration, your speed doubles, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move through creatures and objects willingly though you can not affect them and they can not affect you. You can end this feature early on your turn (no action required). When this effect ends, if you are inside a solid object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. 

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Event Cascade
_**Path of Ethereality:** 13th level_<br>
You have advantage on attack rolls you make against creatures if you haven't dealt damage to them or affected them with a force power since the start of your previous turn.

### Aberrant Self
_**Path of Ethereality:** 18th level_<br>
You no longer suffer the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged abnormally. You can still die of old age, however. Additionally, you no longer need food or water, and you no longer need to sleep. Lastly, the first time you take damage on each of your turns, you can roll your Kinetic Combat die and reduce the damage by that amount.

## Path of Iron 



Many sentinels choose to focus on a discipline that demands physical strength, reflexes, and fortitude. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Iron train their bodies to their physical peak, able to withstand nigh intolerable punishment and bolster their physical combat capabilities. 

### Form Combat Training

You learn one lightsaber form, as detailed in the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. 

Additionally, you gain proficiency in all martial light- and vibro- weapons.

### Physical Conditioning
_**Path of Iron:** 3rd level_<br>
You've undergone special training, increasing your physical capabilities. You gain the following benefits:

- Your hit point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.



### Enhanced Force-Empowered Self
_**Path of Iron:** 7th level_<br>
Through intense physical training, you've improved your body's ability to access and channel the force flowing within you. 

When you would use a Force-Empowered Self option, you can choose to bolster the option, gaining an additional effect as listed below. You can only bolster a Force-Empowered Self option once per turn. 

You can use these features a combined three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 force point to use it.

#### Aegis
When you bolster Deflection, when an attack would hit you before the start of your next turn, you subtract the same value rolled for Deflection from the damage taken.

When you bolster Double Strike, you choose another creature within 5 feet of your target. They take damage of the same type equal to the result of the die rolled for Double Strike.

#### Momentum
When you bolster Slow Time, until the end of your turn you ignore difficult terrain, and can move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling during the move.

### Follow Through

You can do so six times. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

## Path of Meditation
Throughout the Force, there is both symphonic harmony, and discordant chaos. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Meditation embody these concepts, empowering their allies and hindering their enemies through the use of the ancient Force technique of battle meditation.

### Sage Counsel
_**Path of Meditation:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *guidance* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, this power's die increases by one step (from d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).

### Force-Empowered Allies
_**Path of Meditation:** 3rd level_<br>
While you are concentrating on a power that benefits a friendly creature other than you, you gain new ways to utilize your Force-Empowered Self features. Each option costs 1 force point, and you can only target a creature that is benefiting from a power you cast.

#### Deflection
When an ally is hit with an attack roll, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to add it to your ally's AC, potentially causing the attack to miss.

#### Double Strike
When an ally hits with an attack roll, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to deal additional damage of the same type as the attack.

#### Slow Time
When an ally moves on their turn, you can use your reaction and roll a Kinetic Combat die to increase their speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of the turn.

### Unbreakable Focus
_**Path of Meditation:** 7th level_<br>
Once per long rest, you can cast the *battle meditation* force power at its base level without expending force points. While concentrating on *battle meditation*, at the start of each of your turns, the power's die increases by one step (from d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).

Additionally, whenever you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a force power, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Turbulent Presence
_**Path of Meditation:** 13th level_<br>
Once per long rest, you can cast the *improved battle meditation* force power at its base level without expending force points. While concentrating on *improved battle meditation*, at the start of each of your turns, the power's die increases by one step (from d6 to d8, d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).

_**Path of Meditation:** 18th level_<br>
Once per long rest, you can cast the *master battle meditation* force power without expending force points. While concentrating on *master battle meditation*, at the start of each of your turns, the power's die increases by one step (from d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).

## Path of Synthesis
There is power in diversity unknown to those of narrow mind. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Synthesis blend their intricate mastery of the Force with their understanding of technology, creating unique effects to overcome their obstacles.

### Techcasting Secrets
_**Path of Synthesis:** 3rd level_<br>
You have learned to intersperse your training with an aptitude for technology. Choose two tech powers of 1st level or lower. The chosen powers count as universal force powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the sentinel table. 

At 7th level, you learn two tech powers of 2nd level or lower. At 13th level, you learn two tech powers of 3rd level or lower. At 17th level, you learn two tech powers of 4th level or lower. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the tech powers you know and replace it with another tech power of no higher than the level determined by this feature.

### Synthetic Understanding
_**Path of Synthesis:** 3rd level_<br>
You've applied your newfound knowledge to broader pursuits. You gain proficiency in Technology or one tool of your choice.

Additionally, when you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, or a check with a tool, you may use your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) instead of your Intelligence modifier.

Finally, when you deal damage with a tech power or your Double Strike Force Empowered Self option, you can choose to substitute the damage dealt as ion.

### Force-Empowered Tech
_**Path of Synthesis:** 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to fully blend your technological aptitude with your use of the Force. You have three such effects: Disruption Pulse, Force Override, and Techcasting Insight. When you use your Force-Empowered Tech, you choose which effect to create.

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Disruption Pulse
As an action, you can send out a 30 foot cone of electromagnetically-charged energy to overload enemy weapons. Each creature within the cone that is wearing or carrying a weapon with electric components must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the weapon is being worn, this save is made with disadvantage. On a failed save, the first attack they attempt to make with that weapon has disadvantage. A creature with multiple weapons must make a separate save for each weapon.




#### Forced Override
When you cast a tech power that requires a saving throw, you can impose disadvantage on the save (no action required).

#### Techcasting Insight
As an action, you can attempt to determine another creature's experience with techcasting. When you do so, you make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If you succeed, you immediately learn the target's techcasting Max Power Level, as well as any tech powers currently affecting the target.

### Improved Force-Empowered Tech
_**Path of Synthesis:** 13th level_<br>
You've gained access to two additional Force-Empowered Tech effects: Harmonic Synthesis and Conservation of Energy.

#### Harmonic Synthesis
When you use your action to cast a force power, you can use your bonus action to gain resistance to damage dealt by tech powers until the start of your next turn. If you use your action to cast a tech power, you can instead gain resistance to damage dealt by force powers.

#### Conservation of Energy
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a tech power, you can reduce the force point cost of the tech power to 0 (no action required).

### Reflective Shield
_**Path of Synthesis:** 18th level_<br>
When you use your Force-Empowered Tech features, a barrier for energy shimmers into existence, surrounding you until the end of your next turn. When you take damage, you can mitigate the<br> incoming energy and potentially<br> reflect it back at your attacker.<br> You use your reaction to<br> have resistance<br> against the<br> triggering<br> damage, and<br> if the source of the<br> damage is within 5<br> feet of you, they take<br> half of the total damage<br> dealt as ion.

## Path of Tenacity
The tenacious are ever mindful that the Force ebbs and flows, and uses this knowledge to great advantage. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Tenacity use their connection to the Force to draw the opposition's attention while also warding off their attacks, serving as an effective bulwark against even the most implacable of foes.

### Protector
_**Path of Tenacity:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *saber ward* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, when you cast it, you can spend 2 force points to extend the benefits to creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you while the power is active. The creatures immediately lose this benefit if they move more than 5 feet away from you.

### Kinetic Ward
_**Path of Tenacity:** 3rd level_<br>
You can use your reaction to deflect a strike when you are dealt damage by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your sentinel level.<br><br><br><br><br> If you reduce the damage to 0, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 force point to make a melee weapon attack at a target within 5 feet of you with the weapon, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and if the attack hits it uses your Kinetic Combat die for its damage roll. If *saber ward* is active, you have advantage on the attack roll.

### Kinetic Bulwark
_**Path of Tenacity:** 7th level_<br>
You can extend your Kinetic Ward to a creature within 5 feet of you when they are hit by a melee weapon attack. If this damage is not reduced to 0, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. 

### Indomitable
_**Path of Tenacity:** 13th level_<br>
The Force flowing through you makes it harder for movement to be forced upon you. You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being grappled or moved. If you fail the saving throw or ability check, you can spend 1 force point to reroll one of the dice once. You must use the new roll.

Additionally, if allies within 5 feet of you are gaining the benefit of your *saber ward* force power, they also gain the benefit of this feature.




### Kinetic Bastion
_**Path of Tenacity:** 18th level_<br>
You can protect allies even further from you. When a creature within 30 feet of you is hit by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to them and extend your Kinetic Ward. If this damage is not reduced to 0, the warded creature takes any remaining damage. 

You can use this feature six times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

The familiar takes the form of a humanoid or beast made of green, glowing smoke, and it lasts for 1 minute, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another spirit, or until you're incapacitated or die.

Your familiar has an AC equal to your universal force save DC, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you regardless of its appearance, and it occupies its own space. On your turn, you can mentally command the familiar to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your familiar is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed. While you have a familiar, you gain the following benefits:
- As a bonus action, you can use your magicks to teleport, swapping places with your familiar at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the familiar's space. You make this choice for each attack.
- When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your familiar moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the familiar's space.
