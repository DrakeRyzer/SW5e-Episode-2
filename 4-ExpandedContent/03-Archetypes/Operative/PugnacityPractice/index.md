# Pugnacity Practice

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Those operatives who choose the Pugnacity Practice apply an atypical versatility to their actions, comfortably dispatching foes from afar or face to face.

## Tools of the Trade
_**Pugnacity Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You've learned to move swiftly while wielding larger armaments. You gain proficiency with medium armor and martial vibroweapons. If you are already proficient in medium armor, you instead gain proficiency in heavy armor. Additionally, you can deal Sneak Attack damage with any weapon, as long as it does not have the heavy or special properties.

Lastly, you don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, as long as the target of the attack is below its hit point maximum. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.

## Blitz Attack
_**Pugnacity Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You've learned ways to use your martial ability to boost your combat performance. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a blitz attack.

Some of your blitz attacks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the attack's effects. The saving throw DC is as follows:

___



**Blitz Attack save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)



___

### Demoralizing Attack
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

### Diverting Attack
Roll two of your Sneak Attack dice. The first time the target would deal damage before the start of your next turn, that damage is reduced by an amount equal to the resulting roll.

### Warmonger's Attack
If the target makes an attack against you or an allied creature within 5 feet of you before the start of your next turn, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against it.

## Extra Attack
_**Pugnacity Practice:** 9th level_<br>
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can choose to attack twice, instead of once. Additionally, you can deal Sneak Attack damage any number of times on your turn. Each time you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can choose how many Sneak Attack dice you apply. You can't apply more than your total Sneak Attack dice each turn.





## Unrelenting Advance
_**Pugnacity Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws against effects that would grapple or restrain you. Additionally, if you are grappled or restrained, and you could use your action to attempt to end the effect, you can instead use your bonus action.

## Razor Focus
_**Pugnacity Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You can enter a hyper-focused state of mind for 1 minute as a bonus action. You must maintain concentration, as if concentrating on a power. For the duration, each time you successfully deal Sneak Attack damage against a creature, you gain two additional Sneak Attack dice, cumulatively, as your attacks become increasingly precise. These additional dice are lost when your focus ends, whether through failing to maintain concentration or after 1 minute.

The first time you use this feature, you suffer no ill effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you suffer one level of exhaustion each time you use it.
