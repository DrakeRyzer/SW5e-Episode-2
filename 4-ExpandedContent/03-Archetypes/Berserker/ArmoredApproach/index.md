Many berserkers forgo armor and rely on their own fortitude. Berserkers of the Armored Approach, however, embrace the use of armor. Each one customizes their own suit of armor to be used both defensively and offensively, so that the suit becomes an extension of the berserker's own might and fury.

## Spiked Armor
_**Armored Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in armormech's implements. Over the course of a long rest, you can customize a suit of light or medium armor into spiked armor. You must have the armor and armormech's implements in order to perform this modification. You can only have one suit of spiked armor at a time.

This armor gains the barbed (1d4) property. If the armor already has the barbed property, the barbed damage increases by one step (from d4 to d6, or from d6 to d8). Additionally, while raging, you add your rage damage bonus to your barbed damage when you successfully initiate or maintain a grapple.

While wearing your spiked armor, you can use your Constitution modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier when determining your AC.

Additionally, while wearing your spiked armor, you can use your spiked armor as an improvised weapon. When you do so, you are considered proficient with it, and if your armor's barbed damage would be higher than your damage with improvised weapons, you use the barbed damage instead. If you take the Attack action on your turn and make at least one attack with your spiked armor, you can use your bonus action to make an additional attack with your spiked armor against the same target.

## Environmental Shielding
_**Armored Approach:** 6th level_<br>
You customize your spiked armor to better protect you. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic. While wearing your spiked armor, you have resistance to damage of the chosen type. Over the course of a long rest, you can select a different damage type, provided you have the armor and armormech's implements with you.

Additionally, while wearing your spiked armor, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion due to extreme heat or cold.



## Customized Armor
_**Armored Approach:** 10th level_<br>
You learn new ways to customize your spiked armor. Choose one of the following options. While wearing your spiked armor, you gain the effects of the chosen option. Over the course of a long rest, you can select a different option, provided you have the armor and armormech's implements with you.

### Defensive Field
On your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 + your berserker level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Deflective Layer
Your armor class increases by 1.

### Grappling Line
You can use a bonus action to launch a grappling line at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line towards you. If it ends this movement within 5 feet of you, it takes kinetic damage from your armor spikes equal to your Strength modifier.

### Integrated Sonar
You can use an action to give yourself the benefits of the *true sight* force power for 1 hour. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Neural Interface
You are immune to all effects that would cause you to be charmed or frightened.

## Spiked Retribution
_**Armored Approach:** 14th level_<br>
When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes kinetic damage equal to your Strength modifier, as long as you are wearing your spiked armor and you aren't incapacitated.

If you are raging, you add your rage damage bonus to this damage.
