# Way of Confluence

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/consular_confluence.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

The Force binds us, creating an intangible bridge connecting all living things. Those consulars who follow the Way of Confluence master this power, manipulating those connections to both sustain and torment.
 
## Manipulate Life Force
_**Way of Confluence:** 3rd level_<br>
When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a force power, or restore hit points to a creature with 0 hit points with a force power, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).

## Empowered Connection
_**Way of Confluence:** 6th level_<br>
While you have temporary hit points, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to any damage or healing you do with force powers that doesn't already include that modifier. 

## Life Eternal
_**Way of Confluence:** 10th level_<br>
You can use your powerful connection to the Force to keep fighting when others would fall. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can spend 5 force points to drop to 1 hit point instead. 





## Interconnectedness
_**Way of Confluence:** 14th and 17th level_<br>
When you cast a 5th level or lower force power that deals damage or restores hit points and targets only one creature, the power can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. 

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Dynamic Attachment
_**Way of Confluence:** 18th level_<br>
While you have temporary hit points, you have resistance against the damage of force powers, and your force powers ignore resistances.
