## Lead By Example
_**Fireteam Specialist:** 3rd level_<br>
Once per turn, when an ally that can see or hear you attacks a creature that you can see, you can expend a superiority die and enhance that ally's attack, using one of the maneuvers that you know.

## Rally the Troops
_**Fireteam Specialist:** 7th level_<br>
When you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three allies within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. Each ally gains temporary hit points equal to your fighter level.

You can choose an additional ally at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

## On Your Six
_**Fireteam Specialist:** 10th level_<br>
You can use your bonus action to begin a coordinated maneuver with an ally who is within 5 feet of you. For the next minute, while you and the chosen ally are within 5 feet of each other and neither of you are wielding a shield, you each gain a bonus to AC equal to half your proficiency bonus.

When the chosen ally moves on their turn, you can use your reaction to move with them. You must end this movement within 5 feet of the ally, and this movement can't exceed your speed.

This effect ends early if either you or your ally are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.





## Tactical Advice
_**Fireteam Specialist:** 15th level_<br>
Over the course of one minute, you can share knowledge with up to five allies. For the next hour, the chosen creatures gain all of your weapon and armor proficiencies, and a single use of your Indomitable feature. 

You can choose an additional ally at 17th level.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest. 

## No Soldier Left Behind
_**Fireteam Specialist:** 18th level_<br>
While under the effects of On Your Six, if either you or your ally are reduced to 0 hit points, you can end On Your Six to have them drop to 1 hit point instead. When you do so, the effects of On Your Six persist until the start of your next turn.
