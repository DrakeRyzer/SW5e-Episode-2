# Path of Witchcraft (Companion)

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/sentinel_witchcraft.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>




The Force connects all living things. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Witchcraft use that connection to summon the aid of nature, both beasts and the elements, adapting them to their will.

## Bonus Proficiencies
_**Path of Witchcraft:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in Animal Handling.

## Wild Power
_**Path of Witchcraft:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *enfeeble* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use the Double Strike Force-Empowered Self option when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save. Finally, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to damage rolls with it.

## Beast Companion
_**Path of Witchcraft:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to create a powerful bond through the Force with your own  beast companion.

Create your beast companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content.

In addition to its traits and features, your beast companion gains an additional benefit while it is bonded to you:
- Your beast gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each beast trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your force point maximum is reduced by 2. 

Lastly, while bonded and within 10 feet of you, your beast companion gains the following benefits:
- When you use a Force-Empowered Self option to increase your speed or armor class, you can instead grant this bonus to your beast companion. 



- You and your beast companion can communicate telepathically, though your beast companion can only communicate in and understand simple concepts.

This radius increases to 30 feet at 11th level, and 60 feet at 17th level.

## Nature's Vigor
_**Path of Witchcraft:** 7th level_<br>
You've learned to attune your senses with nature. If you spend at least 1 minute meditating while in nature, you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:
- You ignore difficult terrain caused by nature.
- You can understand plants within 30 feet of you. They can telepathically communicate simple ideas to you, including memories from within the past day.
- You can command plants within 30 feet of you to create difficult terrain, or other tasks at the GM's discretion (no action required).

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Beastwarden
_**Path of Witchcraft:** 13th and 17th level_<br>
Your bond with your beast companion strengthens, granting the following benefits while your beast companion is within 30 feet of you:
- When you cast a force power that targets only yourself, and your beast companion is within range, you can also target your beast companion with that power. 
- If you or your beast have darkvision and the other doesn't, the other gains it with the same radius. If you both have darkvision, you both use the larger radius of the two, which then increases by 30 feet.
- If you or your beast have advantage on Perception checks and the other doesn't, the other gains advantage on Perception checks. If you both have advantage on Perception checks, when either of you makes a Perception check with advantage, you can reroll one of the dice once.

This radius increases to 60 feet at 17th level.

## Stormcaller
_**Path of Witchcraft:** 18th level_<br>
You've learned to command the elements to summon a fierce storm in a 30-foot radius around you. As an action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
- You have resistance to energy, lightning, and necrotic damage.
- Whenever a hostile creature enters this radius for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 10 lightning damage.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
