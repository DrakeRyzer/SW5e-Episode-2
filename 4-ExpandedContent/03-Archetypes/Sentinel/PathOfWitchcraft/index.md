# Path of Witchcraft

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/sentinel_withcraft_01.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>


The Force connects all living things. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Witchcraft use that connection to summon the aid of nature, both spirits and the elements, adapting them to their will.

## Wild Power
_**Path of Witchcraft:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *enfeeble* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and you can use the Double Strike Force-Empowered Self option when you cast it as your action and the target fails its save. Finally, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to damage rolls with it.

## Ichor Conjuring
_**Path of Witchcraft:** 3rd and 11th level_<br>
You learn to call on the spirits of beasts and grant them ichorous form. Once on each of your turns, when you cast a force power and deal necrotic damage to a creature, you can conjure a familiar within 5 feet of it (no action required). The familiar takes the form of a humanoid or beast made of green, glowing smoke, and it lasts for 1 minute, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another spirit, or until you're incapacitated or die.

Your familiar has an AC equal to your universal force save DC, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you regardless of its appearance, and it occupies its own space. On your turn, you can mentally command the familiar to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your familiar is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed. While you have a familiar, you gain the following benefits:
- As a bonus action, you can use your magicks to teleport, swapping places with your familiar at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.
- When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the familiar's space. You make this choice for each attack.
- When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your familiar moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the familiar's space.

Starting at 11th level, you can summon your familiar when you deal damage with any force power, instead of just necrotic. Additionally, you can summon your familiar when you use a Force-Empowered Self option on your turn.



## Nature's Vigor
_**Path of Witchcraft:** 7th level_<br>
You've learned to attune your senses with nature. If you spend at least 1 minute meditating while in nature, you gain the following benefits for 1 hour:
- You ignore difficult terrain caused by nature.
- You can understand plants within 30 feet of you. They can telepathically communicate simple ideas to you, including memories from within the past day.
- You can command plants within 30 feet of you to create difficult terrain, or other tasks at the GM's discretion (no action required).

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Waters of Life
_**Path of Witchcraft:** 13th and 17th level_<br>
You've learned to absorb the fleeting magicks of your familiar. When your familiar is destroyed by taking damage, you can choose to grant temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) to one friendly creature of your choice you can see within 30 feet.

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Stormcaller
_**Path of Witchcraft:** 18th level_<br>
You've learned to command the elements to summon a fierce storm in a 30-foot radius around you. As an action, you can gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.
- You have resistance to energy, lightning, and necrotic damage.
- Whenever a hostile creature enters this radius for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 10 lightning damage.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
