The explorer strives to navigate past the known to discover new planets, forgotten ruins, or forbidden locations. Those scholars who choose the Explorer Pursuit spend their time studying maps, landmarks, architecture blue prints, or even history books, using them to effectively lead the way for their companions.

## Focused Navigator
_**Explorer Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in two of the Perception, Piloting, Survival, and Acrobatics skills. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.

## Surveyed Area
_**Explorer Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
You can now use your Critical Analysis feature on a 15-foot cube area within 60 feet of you that you can see. You can treat any creatures inside this cube as if they are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, and when a creature ends your Critical Analysis feature on themself, it does not end this effect for other creatures in your Surveyed Area. 

## Field Advantage
_**Explorer Pursuit:** 6th level_<br>
You learn to quickly convey spatial information in the midst of combat about the area you analyzed, giving them an edge at maneuvering in the area. While moving through your Surveyed Area, you and friendly creatures of your choice ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and opportunity attacks against them are made with disadvantage.

## Unstoppable Adventurer
_**Explorer Pursuit:** 9th level_<br>
You learn to swim and scale vertical surfaces with ease. You gain swimming and climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

Additionally, your Sage Advice feature can be used to give friendly creatures knowledge on how to swim or climb, provided you have a swimming or climbing speed. Chosen creatures have a swimming speed or climbing speed for the entire duration.

## Survey Master
_**Explorer Pursuit:** 17th level_<br>
When you use the Surveyed Area feature, the area affected is a 30-foot cube instead of a 15-foot cube.

When you make an Intelligence (Piloting) check and add your proficiency bonus to the check, treat any roll of 9 or lower as if you had rolled a 10.
