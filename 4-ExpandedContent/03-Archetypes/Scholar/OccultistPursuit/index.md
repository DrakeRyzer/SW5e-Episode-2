<!--- no image <img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/' style='float:right; width:400px;'> --->




Occultists research the obscure practitioners of mystical arts, from witches to shamans to sorcerers. Those scholars who choose the Occultist Pursuit learn to harness these magics to bewitch and confound their enemies. 

## Theurgic Research
_**Occultist Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in the Lore and Nature skills. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.

## Curse of Objurgation 
_**Occultist Pursuit:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
When you target a creature with your Critical Analysis, you can choose one ability. While it can see you, the target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability.

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

## Heightened Hex
_**Occultist Pursuit:** 6th level_<br>
When you use your Curse of Objurgation feature, each time the cursed creature deals damage to you or an allied creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the creature takes psychic damage equal to twice your Critical Analysis ability modifer (minimum of 2).



## Voodoo Doll
_**Occultist Pursuit:** 9th level_<br>
Over the course of an hour, which can be done during a short rest, you can perform a ritual to construct an effigy of a creature. In order to do so, you must have at least heard of or seen the creature before, and the target must be in the same system as you. At the end of the hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. This saving throw is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it, as shown in the Knowledge Save Modifier and Connection Save Modifier tables below. 

#### Knowledge Save Modifier

|:--|--:|
|Secondhand (you have heard of the target) |+5|
|Firsthand (you have met the target) |+0|
|Familiar (you know the target well) |-5|

#### Connection Save Modifier

|:--|--:|
|Likeness or picture |-2|
|Curse of Objurgation |-3|
|Possession or garment |-4|
|Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like |-10|

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this ritual against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the ritual creates a Tiny doll that is linked to the target. The doll remains linked for 24 hours, or for 10 minutes after you first use it. It disintegrates at the end of this duration. For the duration, you can see and hear the target through the doll as if you were within 5 feet of the creature.

Additionally, as action while the doll is in your possession, you can expend a Hit Die to torment the target, choosing an effect from the following options:
- **Burn:** The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target believes it is burning. While burning in this way, the target has has disadvantage on attack rolls made with Strength or Dexterity. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
- **Pain:** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be wracked with pain for 1 hour. While in pain in this way, the target takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage whenever it takes damage.
- **Stab:** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain 2 slowed levels and fall prone. The slowed levels effect lasts for 1 hour.

The target can only be under 1 effect at a time. When you use a new effect, any existing effects end. Placing an effect on a target requires maintaining your concentration, as if concentrating on a power.

You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.





## Toil and Trouble
_**Occultist Pursuit:** 17th level_<br>
You perfect your control of your curses, granting them unmatched potency. When the target of your Curse of 

Objurgation fails a saving throw against one of your maneuvers, you can choose to amplify that maneuver by expending a number of Hit Dice of your choice. The target immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage for every Hit Die spent in this way.

Additionally, when a creature attempts to use a power like *remove curse* or other similar abilities to remove a curse you set, they must roll a Wisdom or Charisma check (their choice) against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, their attempt fails, and any force or tech points spent in this way are wasted.

When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your research on the occult. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order.

### Arcane Membrane
You have advantage on Intelligence (Lore) or Intelligence (Nature) checks.

### Evil Eye

You can cast the *bestow curse* and *remove curse* force powers without spending force points. Wisdom or Charisma (your choice) is your forcecasting modifier for these powers.

Once you've cast a power using this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can cast it again.

### Exsanguination
_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_<br>
When a creature marked by your Curse of Objurgation is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use a reaction and expend a Hit Die to immediately regain a use of your Curse of Objurgation.

### Hexes and Superstitions 
When you roll a 13 on an ability check, you treat it as if you rolled a 20.

### Natural Karma
Before you use a maneuver or power to set a curse on a target you can see, you can make a contested Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, the target is unaware you set the curse on them.

### Savage Sortilege

You ignore resistance to psychic damage, and you have resistance to psychic damage.

### Supernatural Vigor
At the end of a long rest, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet (this includes you) to imbue with unnatural power. The creature's hit point maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to your scholar level, and it has advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid exhaustion. Both effects end after 8 hours.
