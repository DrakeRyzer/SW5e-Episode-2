When you target yourself with your Critical Analysis feature, you can choose to undergo a mutagenic transformation. Your form shifts, exaggerating and strengthening your geneticist discoveries for 1 hour. You gain the following benefits:

- Your Strength score becomes equal to your Critical Analysis score.
- You gain a bonus to your AC equal to half your Critical Analysis ability modifer (minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.

You can end this effect early on your turn as a bonus action. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Adapted Hide
When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, you are adapted to hot or cold climates (your choice), as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you add your full Critical Analysis ability modifer, instead of half, to your AC for the duration.

You can breathe air and water. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you no longer need to breathe, and you can survive up to one hour within the vacuum of space for the duration.


### Enhanced Musculature
Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples. Additionally, when you make a long jump, you can cover a number of feet up to twice your Strength score. When you make a high jump, you can leap a number of feet up into the air equal to 3 + twice your Strength modifier. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws for the duration.

### Icarian Mutation
You sprout a pair of winged arms. You gain a flying speed equal to half your walking speed. You can only gain the benefit of items held by two of your arms at any given time, and once per round you can switch which arms you are benefiting from (no action required). When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, your flying speed increases to your full walking speed, and you can use your bonus action to take the Dash action for the duration.

### Mutagenic Hardiness
Your hit point maximum increases by a number equal to your level, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, and at the beginning of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your half your scholar level + your Critical Analysis ability modifer for the duration.

### Predatory Senses
You have darkvision out to 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range instead increases by 30 feet.

Additionally, you can track creatures that have left a scent in the last 24 hours.

### Underground Adaptation
You gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed and you can tunnel through solid rock at a rate of 1 foot per round. In order to use this speed, you must have two free hands. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, you gain tremorsense out to 30 feet for the duration. You can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.

### Unnatural Weaponry
You sprout claws or some other natural weapon. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage, and you can use your choice of your Strength, Dexterity, or Critical Analysis ability modifer for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. When you undergo your mutagenic transformation, your unarmed strikes increase to a d6 and are considered enhanced for the duration. Additionally, you deal an additional 1d4 acid, lightning, or poison damage when you hit with them.
