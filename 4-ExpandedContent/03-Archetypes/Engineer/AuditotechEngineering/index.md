<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/engineer_audiotech.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Those engineers who choose the Audiotech Engineering discipline focus on using a specially modified instrument to use music to assist their allies and disrupt their enemies.

## Bonus Proficiencies
_**Audiotech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in three musical instruments and audiotech's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with audiotechâ€™s implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

## Modified Instrument
_**Audiotech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to modify an instrument utilizing your audiotech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify an instrument. You must have the instrument and audiotech's implements in order to perform this modification.

Your modified instrument is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified instrument has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

## Potent Amplitude
_**Audiotech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
As an action while wielding your modified instrument, you can begin performing an enhanced song, which lasts for 1 minute. While playing a song, you gain access to a new use for your Potent Aptitude, as determined by the song, listed below. You can end your song at any time, no action required.

Whenever you take damage while playing your song, you must make a Constitution saving throw to continue playing. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, which number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, you must make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.

When you cast a damage dealing tech power while playing your song that requires an attack roll or saving throw, you can cause that power to instead deal sonic damage. If you do so, instead of an attack roll or saving throw, the power instead requires a Constitution saving throw.

Your song ends early if you are incapacitated or die, or if you are no longer holding your modified instrument.

You can initiate playing an enhanced song twice. You regain all expended songs when you finish a short or long rest.




### Song of Battle
When an ally within 60 feet of you that can hear you deals damage to a creature, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude, adding the result of the die to the damage dealt.

### Song of Support
When an ally within 60 feet of you that can hear you makes a saving throw against a harmful effect, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude, adding the result of the die to their saving throw.

### Song of Disruption
When an enemy within 60 feet of you that can hear you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude, subtracting the result of the die from their saving throw.

## Concussive Blast
_**Audiotech Engineering:** 6th level_<br>
You add your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with tech powers and class features that deal sonic damage.

## Smooth Rhythm
_**Audiotech Engineering:** 14th level_<br>
Whenever you use your Potent Aptitude while your playing an enhanced song, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Potent Aptitude Dice.

## Legendary Coda
_**Audiotech Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
You've gained mastery over your modified instrument. As an action, you can end your enhanced song in a triumphant blast of power with an effect determined by the song you are playing.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Battle Crescendo
Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Each must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14d6 sonic damage and is stunned for 1d4+1 turns. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't stunned. If a creature is killed by this power, its head explodes.

### Support Crescendo
Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Once in the next minute, each creature can, as a free action in response to taking damage, choose to halve that damage. Additionally, if the damage would reduce them to 0 hit points, they are instead reduced to 1.

### Disruption Crescendo
Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that you can see and that can hear your song. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 turns. If a creature affected by this feature is damaged in any way, the effect ends for that creature.
