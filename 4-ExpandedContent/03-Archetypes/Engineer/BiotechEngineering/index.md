# Biotech Engineering

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/engineer_biotech.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Those engineers who choose the Biotech Engineering discipline focus on the skill of modifying and upgrading the body through the use of cybernetic limbs and implants.

## Bonus Proficiencies
_**Biotech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in biotech's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with biotech's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

## Modified Self
_**Biotech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You've learned to make modifications to your body, cybernetically augmenting yourself. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify yourself with cybernetic augmentations. You must have biotech's implements in order to perform this modification.

While you have at least one cybernetic augmentation installed, your body counts as a tech focus for your tech powers. Additionally, you have 4 modification slots, and you gain more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

## Quick-Release Stimulant
_**Biotech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
When you are dealt damage by an attack while you have at least one cybernetic augmentation installed, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to reduce the damage you take. The damage is reduced by an amount equal to 1d10 + your Constitution modifier + your engineer level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can gain temporary hit points equal to the remaining damage reduction.

## Overclock Body
_**Biotech Engineering:** 6th level_<br>
You've learned to use your body as a conduit for your tech powers. When you cast a tech power, you can choose to pay up to half the cost of the tech power using your hit points instead of your tech points. When you do so, your maximum hit points are reduced by the same amount until you complete a long rest.

## More Machine Than Man
_**Biotech Engineering:** 14th level_<br>
While you have temporary hit points, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.




## Focused Augmentation
_**Biotech Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
You add your Intelligence modifier to Constitution saving throws you make to maintain concentration.

Additionally, when you cast a power that requires concentration and would affect only one target, you can target an additional creature with that power.

## Biotech Modifications
If a modification has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the modification at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

### Active Camouflage Core

A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the harpoon. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the harpoon. Removing the harpoon requires a Strength check. While the harpoon is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.

While the harpoon is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is larger than you. A creature or object your size or smaller is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).
