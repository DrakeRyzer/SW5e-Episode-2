# Biochem Engineering

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/engineer_biochem.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Those engineers who choose the Biochem Engineering discipline focus on utilizing their vast knowledge of medicine and chemistry to supply allies with potent healing and enemies with debilitating poisons and acids.

## Bonus Proficiencies
_**Biochem Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill, biochemist's kits, and poisoner's kits. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with biochemist's kits and poisoner's kits, the rate at which you craft doubles.

## Modified Biochemist's Pack
_**Biochem Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to modify and combine your biochemist's kit and poisoner's kit, creating a mobile laboratory using your chemistry expertise. Over the course of a long rest, you can create your modified biochemist's pack. You must have a biochemist's kit, a poisoner's kit, and materials in order to perform this modification.

Your biochemist's pack is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified biochemist's pack has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

Your modified biochemist's pack comes equipped with a chemical distribution system, complete with three chemical mixtures: corrosive, invigorating, and noxious. As an action, you can activate your distributor and target a creature within 30 feet, with an effect determined by the mixture.

### Corrosive Mixture
Your distributor emits a burst of acid. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier acid damage. This mixture's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

### Invigorating Mixture
Your distributor emits a bolt of kolto. The target gains 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier temporary hit points, which last until the end of your next turn. The temporary hit points granted by this mixture increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).




### Noxious Mixture
Your distributor emits a cloud of poison. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier poison damage. This mixture's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

## Biochemist's Touch
_**Biochem Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
Whenever you grant temporary hit points, or deal acid or poison damage using a tech power or class feature, you may expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to increase the potency. When you do so, the amount of temporary hit points you grant or damage you deal is increased by the amount rolled on the die. The damage is the same type as the original damage.

## Potent Mixtures
_**Biochem Engineering:** 6th level_<br>
When you cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher that grants temporary hit points, or deals acid or poison damage, you add your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of +1) to the roll.

## Epicenter
_**Biochem Engineering:** 14th level_<br>
As a reaction when you take damage from a creature within 15 feet of you that you can see, you can use one of your mixtures. The effects of the mixture release in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on you, and if the mixture requires a saving throw, you automatically succeed on it. Additionally, the affected area is difficult terrain to creatures other than you until the end of your next turn.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Masterful Mixtures
_**Biochem Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
When you deal acid or poison damage using a tech power or class feature, you ignore resistance and treat immunity as resistance.

### Expanded Mixtures: Adhesive
You've created a new mixture from your chemicals that you can use when you activate your distributor. When you do so, the target creature must make a Strength saving throw. If the creature is Large or larger, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, a creature gains 4 slowed levels until the start of your next turn. As an action on their turn, an affected creature can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. 

### Expanded Mixtures: Blinding

When you hit with the weapon, you can activate your distributor to deploy one of your mixtures. If you do so, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw against your mixture.

### Inoculation
You gain immunity to the poisoned and disease conditions.

### Integrated EVA Functionality
You make several additions to your modified biochemist's pack, you are protected from hazardous conditions, as if wearing an EVA suit, for as long as you are wearing your modified biochemist's pack.

### Kolto Aerosol
_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_<br>
You add a special dispersal system to your modified biochemist's pack. This system slowly disperses small amounts of kolto in the air.
