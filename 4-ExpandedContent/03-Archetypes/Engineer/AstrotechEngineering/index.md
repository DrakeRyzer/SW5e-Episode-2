# Astrotech Engineering

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/engineer_astrotech.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Those engineers who choose the Astrotech Engineering discipline focus on utilizing their vast knowledge of droid technology to confuse, confound, and destroy enemy tech, droids and constructs.

## Bonus Proficiencies
_**Astrotech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in astrotech's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with astrotech's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

## Electronic Warfare Platform
_**Astrotech Engineering:** 3rd, 9th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to modify your astrotech's implements into a mobile electronic warfare platform. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify your astrotech's implements. You must have astrotech's implements in order to perform this modification.

Your electronic warfare platform is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your electronic warfare platform has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

Your electronic warfare platform comes equipped with electromagnetic projection and sensing systems, enabling three fields: ionizing, jamming, and targeting. As a bonus action, you can activate a field, which lasts for 1 minute, causing an effect determined by the field. Only one field can be active at a time, and you can end your field at any time on your turn, no action required. The range of your barriers increases to 15 feet at 9th level and 30 feet at 17th level. You can use these fields a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the engineer table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Ionizing Field
Whenever a droid or construct other than you starts its turn within 5 feet of you, it gains 4 slowed levels and takes ion damage equal to half your engineer level. 

### Jamming Field
Whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you are forced to make a saving throw by a tech power, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). 

### Targeting Field
You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you gain a bonus to the first ranged weapon damage rolls you make each round equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). 

## Potent Electromagnetism
_**Astrotech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
Once per round, when you deal damage to a droid or construct, you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to deal an extra 2d6 damage to that target. The damage is the same type as the source of the damage.

The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.

## Direct Controller
_**Astrotech Engineering:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
Your mastery of droids improves your ability to manipulate them. When you cast a power that could affect only droids or constructs, and you only affect droids with the power, you can choose to treat the power as if cast at your Max Power Level.

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

## Systems Hijack
_**Astrotech Engineering:** 14th level_<br>
All droids, constructs, and creatures wearing or holding a techcasting focus within 120 feet are viable targets for any tech powers which you cast with a range of touch.

## Electromagnetic Burst
_**Astrotech Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
As an action, you can end your field in a electromagnetic burst of power with an effect determined by the field you were generating.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Ionizing Burst
Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that are within 60 feet. Each must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14d6 ion damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't stunned.

### Jamming Burst
Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that are within 60 feet. Once in the next minute, when a chosen creature fails a saving throw caused by a tech power or is hit by an attack power, the creature can choose to succeed on the saving throw or have the attack miss instead.

### Targeting Burst
Choose up to 10 creatures of your choice that are within 60 feet. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC or be blinded for 1d4+1 turns.
