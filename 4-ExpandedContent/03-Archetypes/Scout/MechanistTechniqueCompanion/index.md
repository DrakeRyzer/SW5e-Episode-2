<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/scout_mechanist_01.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>




Some scouts are peerless inventors, skilled at working with droids and other forms of technology. Followers of the Mechanist Technique utilize the assistance of a tracker droid companion to make up for the weakness of organics with the strength and purity of their creations.

## Bonus Proficiencies
_**Mechanist Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in astrotechâ€™s implements.

## Improved Techcasting
_**Mechanist Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
Your command of techcasting improves.

### Improved Tech Powers Known
You know 7 tech powers of your choice, instead of 5, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

### Improved Tech Points
You have a number of tech points equal to one and a half times your scout level, instead of your scout level, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.

### Improved Max Power Level
Your Max Power Level becomes 2nd, instead of 1st, and it increases at higher levels, as shown in the Mechanist Technique Techcasting table.

You may only cast tech powers at 5th, 6th, and 7th-level once, instead of 4th and 5th. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

## Tracker Droid Companion
_**Mechanist Technique:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own tracker droid companion.

Create your tracker droid companion as detailed in the Companions section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. You must have astrotech's implements in order to create your droid.

In addition to its traits and features, your tracker droid companion gains an additional benefit while it is bonded to you:
- Your tracker droid gains two additional traits. It gains one more additional trait when you reach 11th level in this class. For each droid trait in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of droid traits equal to half your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).



Lastly, while your tracker droid companion is bonded and within 10 feet of you, you can use your action to learn the location of any droid or construct, tech focus, tech power or enhanced item within 60 feet of you or your tracker droid that isn't behind total cover. When you sense a tech power in this way, you learn what the power is. At 11th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 30 feet of you or your target to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, your tracker droid companion must be within 60 feet. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

## Mark of the Mechanist
_**Mechanist Technique:** 7th level_<br>
As a bonus action, you can cause the target of your Ranger's Quarry to emit an ion pulse, as long as the target is within 60 feet of you. The target, and any creatures within 5 feet of it, must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, roll your Ranger's Quarry die; each creature takes ion damage equal to the amount rolled.









## High Voltage
_**Mechanist Technique:** 11th level_<br>
You are used to working with electronics and have learned to increase their potency, while becoming inured to their dangers. You gain resistance to ion and lightning damage.

Additionally, whenever you deal ion damage to a creature, you can spend a tech point to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is stunned until the end of your next turn.

## Command Droid
_**Mechanist Technique:** 15th level_<br>
You can reprogram a droid and bring it under your control. As an action, you can touch one droid that you can see that is the target of your Ranger's Quarry. That creature must make a Intelligence saving throw against your tech save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again for 24 hours. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.

Intelligent droids are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.
