<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/scout_inquisitor.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Across history, there have been those who live to hunt those who wield the Force, be they Jedi or Sith. Followers of the Inquisitor Technique combine technology with force techniques to track down and eliminate force-wielders. For those practitioners of the Force, they are the greatest adversary.

## Forcecasting Secrets
_**Inquisitor Technique:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You have learned secrets from a subtle attunement to the force. Choose two force powers of no higher level than your Max Power Level, as shown in the scout table. The chosen powers count as tech powers for you, but are not included in the number in the Powers Known column of the scout table.

You learn two additional powers at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the force powers you know and replace it with another force power of no higher level than your Max Power Level.

## Mark of the Inquisitor
_**Inquisitor Technique:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
When the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature is within 15 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
- Whenever the creature casts a force power, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC to maintain concentration. On a failed save, the casting is disrupted, the force power fails, and the force points are wasted.
- Whenever the creature starts its turn while concentrating on a force power, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your tech save DC to maintain concentration. On a failed save, it loses concentration on the power.

The radius of this feature increases to 30 feet at 11th level and 60 feet at 17th level.

## Sense Force
_**Inquisitor Technique:** 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You can use your action to gain the benefits of the *force sight* force power until the end of your next turn.

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Force Resistance
_**Inquisitor Technique:** 11th and 17th level_<br>
While the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature is within 30 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on saving throws against force powers they cast.
- You have resistance to damage dealt by force powers they cast. 

The radius of this feature increases to 60 feet at 17th level.




## Inquisitor's Wrath
_**Inquisitor Technique:** 15th and 17th level_<br>
You can cast the *force suppression* and *sever force* force powers at 3rd level against the target of your Ranger's Quarry without expending tech points. If they are within 30 feet of you, you have advantage on the forcecasting ability check for these powers.

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

The radius of this feature increases to 60 feet at 17th level.
