# Artillerist Technique

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/scout_artillerist.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>




Some scouts choose to navigate around defenses, while others choose to go through them. Followers of the Artillerist Technique learn to exert greater control of their tech powers, causing delayed—and often empowered—effects.

## Modular Munitions
_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
When you cast a tech power, rather than having it take effect instantly, you can choose to delay the effect to occur on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). When you do so, any creature that leaves the affected area of your tech power is unaffected when the tech power occurs. If the power would only target one creature, and that creature moves from the space it was in when you cast the power, the tech power automatically misses if it would call for an attack roll, as if you had rolled a 1 on the attack, and the creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw against the power if it calls for a saving throw, as if it had rolled a 20 on the save.

Additionally, when you cast a tech power and choose to delay it in this way, and that tech power would deal damage, you can apply one of the following additional empowerment effects:
- **Flashbang**: Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded and deafened until the start of your next turn.
- **Mire:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or gain one slowed level until the start of your next turn.
- **Psyche:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the start of your next turn.

If an empowerment effect calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your tech save DC.

You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can instead expend 1 tech point to use it. When you do so, your maximum tech points are reduced by 1 until you complete a long rest.

## Mark of the Artillerist
_**Artillerist Technique:** 3rd and 11th level_<br>
You can now use your Ranger's Quarry feature on a 10-foot cube area within 60 feet of you that you can see. You can treat any creatures inside this cube as if they are the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature, and when a creature is hit by a tech attack or fails a saving throw against a tech power you cast that deals damage, you can apply your Ranger's Quarry damage to that creature.

At 11th level, you can now use your Ranger's Quarry feature on a 15-foot cube area, instead of a 10-foot cube.



## Sundered Defenses
_**Artillerist Technique:** 7th level_<br>
Your precise bombardments make even the most hardened defenses crumble. When you cast a power that calls for a tech attack or a Dexterity saving throw, it reduces partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter) against creatures affected by it. If an affected creature has one-quarter cover, your power ignores it entirely.

## Target Masking
_**Artillerist Technique:** 11th level_<br>
You are familiar with various turrets and defensive emplacements, and their operation. 

As a bonus action, you can activate a masking effect to confuse the targeting of constructs for 1 minute. Any construct who targets you with an attack, a harmful power, or a hostile action must first make a Wisdom saving throw against your tech save DC. On a failed save, the construct must choose a new target or lose the attack or power. This power doesn't protect you from area effects.

You can use this feature a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scout table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

## Master of Ordnance
_**Artillerist Technique:** 15th level_<br>
You can now expend two uses of your Modular Munitions feature when you cast a tech power to apply two empowerment effects, instead of only one. Additionally, you gain three additional empowerment effects:
- **Confusion:** Each creature damaged by this power must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, on its next turn, a creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.
- **Knockout:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Static:** Each creature damaged by this power must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become shocked until the start of your next turn.

Additionally, when you would spend 1 tech point to apply an empowerment effect, it no longer reduces your maximum tech points.
