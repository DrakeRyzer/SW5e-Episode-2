Jar'Kai Form, also known as Domination Form, utilizes two weapons to overwhelm their foes. Those guardians who focus on Jar'Kai Form know that two weapons offer greater versatility than one, and capitalize on the twin angles from which they attack to subdue their enemies.

## Form Basics
_**Jar'Kai Form:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain the Jar'Kai lightsaber form, detailed in Chapter 6 of the Player's Handbook. If you already know this form, you can instead choose another lightsaber form.

## The Way of the Acklay
_**Jar'Kai Form:** 3rd level_<br>
As a bonus action, you can enter a destructive stance for one minute. While in this stance, you can add half your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice, minimum of one) to any melee weapon damage roll you make that doesn't already include that modifier. Additionally, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Channel the Force
_**Jar'Kai Form:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain the following Channel the Force option.

### Twin Strike
Once per turn, when you miss with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to immediately make another melee weapon attack against the same target (no action required).

## Eye of the Storm
_**Jar'Kai Form:** 7th level_<br>
When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you regain an expended use of your Channel the Force.

## Rising Whirlwind
_**Jar'Kai Form:** 15th level_<br>
As an action, you can rush forward up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of your path must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with your weapon). A creature takes normal weapon damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If you are wielding separate two light- or vibro-weapons in each hand with which you are proficient, or a weapon with the double property, a creature makes this save with disadvantage, and takes additional damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice, minimum of one) on a failed save if it doesn't already include that modifier.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.




## Master of Domination
_**Jar'Kai Form:** 20th level_<br>
You are a whirlwind of strikes, eviscerating all who step within your reach. Your Strength and Dexterity scores increase by 2. Your maximum for these scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You have resistance to kinetic, energy, and ion damage from weapons.
- When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you have advantage on the next melee weapon attack roll you make against that creature, and that creature provokes an opportunity attack from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach until the end of your next turn.
- Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter your reach.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
