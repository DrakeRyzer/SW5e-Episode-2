Juyo/Vaapad Form, also known as Ferocity Form, revels in the satisfaction of battle and victory. Those guardians who focus on Juyo/Vaapad Form channel their emotions into their fighting, making heavy, sweeping strikes.

You gain proficiency in heavy armor.

## Form Basics
_**Juyo/Vaapad Form:** 3rd level_<br>

## The Way of the Vornskr

As a bonus action, you can take a savage stance, designating one creature you can see within 10 feet of you as your prey for 1 minute. You have advantage on attack rolls against the creature. If the target drops to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn to mark a new creature.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.

If you are surprised at the start of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to act normally on your first turn.

### Assertive Defense
When you reduce the damage dealt by a force power to 0 using the *saber reflect* power, and you're wielding a lightweapon or vibroweapon, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to reflect the attack at a target within range, regardless of what type the damage is.

You have advantage on initiative checks, and gain a 10 foot bonus to your speed on your first turn of combat.

### Punishing Charge 
When a hostile creature you can see or hear within 30 feet of you casts a force power, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.
