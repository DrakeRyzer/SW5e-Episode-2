Vonil/Ishu Form, also known as Unity Form, focuses on fighting in tandem with your allies. Those guardians who focus on Vonil/Ishu Form utilize teamwork to move swiftly, strike quickly, and protect each other from harm.

## Form Basics
_**Vonil/Ishu Form:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain your choice of the Vonil or Ishu lightsaber form, detailed in the Lightsaber Forms section of the Customization Options document for Expanded Content. If you already know the chosen form, you can instead choose another lightsaber form.

## The Way of the Hydra
_**Vonil/Ishu Form:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
As a bonus action, you can enter a synchronized stance with one ally of your choice within 10 feet of you for 1 minute. While in this stance, once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack, the chosen ally has advantage on the next attack it makes against the same target before the end of your next turn. Additionally, once per turn, when the chosen ally hits a creature with an attack, you have advantage on the next attack you make against the same target before the end of your next turn.

This effect ends early if either you or the chosen ally are incapacitated or die, or if the chosen ally is ever more than 10 feet away from you. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.

At 11th level, the chosen ally must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, the chosen ally must be within 60 feet.

## Channel the Force
_**Vonil/Ishu Form:** 3rd, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You gain one of the following Channel the Force options. Choose Smite for Vonil or Shield for Ishu.

### Smite
Once per turn, when an ally is within 10 feet of you and it hits a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and expend force points to have the chosen ally deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.

At 11th level, the chosen ally must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, the chosen ally must be within 60 feet.

### Shield
When an ally is hit by a weapon attack while within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction and expend a use of your Channel the Force to attempt to divert the attack. When you do so, the damage the chosen ally takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) + your guardian level.



At 11th level, the chosen ally must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, the chosen ally must be within 60 feet.

## Amplified Auras
_**Vonil/Ishu Form:** 7th, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
Once on each of your turns, you can choose an ally within 10 feet of you. While the chosen ally is within 10 feet of you, your auras emit from that ally as if you were standing in that ally's space. A creature in the area of more than one instance of your auras is affected only once.

At 11th level, the chosen ally must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from this feature. At 17th level, the chosen ally must be within 60 feet.

## Teamwork

## Master of Unity
_**Vonil/Ishu Form:** 20th level_<br>
You and your allies are a paragon of harmony. Your Strength or Dexterity (your choice) and Constitution scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action and choose an ally within 60 feet of you to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You and the chosen ally have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.
- Neither you nor the chosen ally can have disadvantage on attack rolls.
- Both you and the chosen ally's critical hit ranges increase by 1.
