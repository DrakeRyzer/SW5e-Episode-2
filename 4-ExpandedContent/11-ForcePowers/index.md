#### Agile Defense
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

As part of the action of casting this power, you take the Dodge action.

#### Art of Movement
_3rd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Instinctive Movement
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

By letting the Force flow through you, you move with preternatural grace, leaping onto or over tall obstacles that impede others. Until the power ends, you gain the following benefits:
- Your speed increases by 10 feet.
- You have resistance to damage from falling.
- Your jumping distance is tripled.
- You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. If you are on a vertical surface when you end your turn and are not using your hands to climb, you immediately fall unless you have some other means of remaining there.
- Your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain or squeezing.
- You ignore the effects of slowed levels under 3.

Once before the power ends, you can give yourself advantage on one weapon attack roll on your turn. That attack deals an extra 1d10 force damage on a hit. Whether you hit or miss, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of that turn.

#### Battlemind
_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Battle Precognition
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Through the Force, you gain a limited form of telepathy that enables you to anticipate the moves of your opponents in combat. While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain a +2 AC bonus against melee attacks and a +3 AC bonus against ranged attacks.

This AC bonus is not applied against attacks from droids, constructs, or creatures with resistance or immunity to psychic damage.

#### Break
_At-will universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You inflict 10 force damage to an object you can see within range that is not being worn or carried, generating an explosion of sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away. Even if the object is not destroyed, small shards of shrapnel fly at creatures within 5 feet of it. Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d4 kinetic damage. 

This power’s kinetic damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4), and the power’s force damage also increases by 10 at each of these levels.

#### Defensive Technique
_At-will light side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Varies
- **Duration:** 1 round

As part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and you ward yourself from it through the Force.

If the target forces you to make a saving throw before the start of your next turn, the target takes an additional 1d6 psychic damage, and you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to your saving throw. The power then ends.

The power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic damage to the target, and the psychic damage the target takes for forcing you to make a saving throw increases to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th level and 17th level.

#### Force Current
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Force Push/Pull
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot cone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this power, you raise your hand and unleash a burst of Force energy. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 force damage and, if it is Large or smaller, is also pushed back 5 feet. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. All Medium or smaller objects that are not worn or carried within the area of effect are also pushed 5 feet.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. For each slot 2 levels higher than 1st, you can add an additional 5 feet to the push.

#### Force Intuition
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 8 hours

Your senses attune to your environment for the duration, allowing you to see things before they happen, and react even faster than normal. For the duration, you can use your forcecasting ability modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier when you make initiative checks, if the check doesn't already include that modifier. 

In addition, once during the duration of this power, if you are surprised at the start of combat, rather than being completely unable to act, you can still use a reaction, and take an action on your first turn in combat. This action can be used only to take one of the following actions: Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Hide, or Use an Object.

#### Greater Kinetite
_5th-level dark side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Kinetite
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 5-foot diameter sphere of compressed lightning appears in an unoccupied space of your choice and lasts for the duration. Each creature within 5 feet of the sphere when the power is cast must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can move the ball of lightning up to 30 feet vertically or horizontally. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d8 kinetic damage (or half as much damage on a success), and the sphere stops moving this turn. A creature takes half as damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power with a force slot of 6th level or higher, both the lightning and kinetic damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Greater Pyrokinesis
_4th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Improved Pyrokinesis
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of Force-enhanced fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration. 

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 energy damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. 

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this power, deals 5d8 energy damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Heighten Senses
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you would roll initiative
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 round

Through the Force, you sense a sudden shift in your environment, and can seize on it with great speed. You gain advantage on your initiative check, and until the end of your first turn in combat, your walking speed increases by 30 feet.

#### Improved Force Intuition
_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Force Intuition
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you would roll initiative
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You make your initiative check at advantage, and gain a +2 bonus to AC until the power ends. In addition, until the end of your first turn in the combat, your speed increases by 10 feet and you add 1d4 to your attack rolls. This power ends early if you fail a saving throw or are hit by an attack.

#### Improved Kinetite
_4th-level dark side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Kinetite
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 20-foot-radius sphere of compressed lightning springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the power’s duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 kinetic damage. The sphere’s space is difficult terrain.

Until the power ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged force attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.

Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power with a force slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases for each of its effects by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Improved Pyrokinesis
_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Pyrokinesis
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A line of roaring Force-enhanced flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 energy damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Instinctive Movement
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Wall Run
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You enhance your movement with the Force, allowing you to traverse your environment with speed and acrobatic grace. When you cast this power, you gain two speed points. When you cast the power and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can expend a speed point, granting yourself all of the following benefits until the end of that turn:
- Your speed increases by 5 feet. 
- You have resistance to falling damage. 
- You ignore difficult terrain. 
- You have a climb speed equal to your walking speed. 
- You add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. 
- You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. 
- You do not sink when moving over soft or brittle terrain, such as dust, silt, mud, snow, or thin ice. This effect does not allow you to move across liquid surfaces.
- If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hit it with a melee weapon attack for the first time on the same turn, you deal an extra 1d4 damage with that attack.

At the end of the turn, the benefits fade entirely until you spend another speed point. If these benefits end while you are still on a vertical surface, or anywhere else where you would normally fall or sink, you immediately fall or begin to sink unless you have some other means to remain there. 

This power ends when its duration expires, when you cast this power again, or when you have spent all your speed points. When the power ends, any unspent speed points are lost.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st. In addition, if you cast this power with a force slot of 3rd level or higher, you gain one additional speed point for every two slot levels above 1st.

#### Kinetite
_2nd-level dark side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Sustained Lightning
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 5-foot-diameter sphere of compressed lightning appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one, and the sphere stops moving this turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power with a force slot of 3rd level or higher, both the lightning and kinetic damage increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Land Stride
_1st-level light side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (40-foot radius)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You align yourself with nature, making traversing natural environments far easier. For the duration, your movement and that of creatures of your choice within 40 feet of you can't be slowed by natural terrain, such as mud, rocky ground, vines, or tall grass. Climbing still costs double normal movement. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no traces of its passage.

#### Master Pyrokinesis
_7th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Greater Pyrokinesis
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A storm made up of sheets of roaring, Force-enhanced flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 energy damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one cube is affected only once.

The flame damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

#### Phaseshift
_At-will universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Too quickly for untrained eyes to perceive, you shift in position. You can move up to 5 feet, and this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

#### Probe Mind
_2nd-level dark side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Sense Emotion
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the power and as your action on each turn until the power ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected. 

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it takes 1d6 psychic damage as you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the power ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your forcecasting ability check; if it succeeds, the power ends.

On subsequent turns after probing deeper, you can use your action to deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target automatically.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this power is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this power to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the power or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The power can penetrate barriers. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language. 

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.

This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial psychic damage a target takes the first time you probe deeper into its mind increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Pull Earthward
_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Force Propel
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or its flying speed (if any) is reduced to 0 feet for the power’s duration. An airborne creature affected by this power descends at 60 feet per round until it reaches the ground or the power ends.

#### Pyrokinesis
_At-will universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

By stimulating air molecules, you create a zone of Force-enhanced fire on ground that you can see within range. Until the power ends, the enhanced fire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the fire's space when you cast the power must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 energy damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the fire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The fire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.

The power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Reveal Shatterpoint
_5th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Sense Shatterpoint
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You focus on a creature you can see within range, and gain uncanny insight on its defenses and capabilities through the Force. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you for the duration. On a successful save, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against that creature, and it has disadvantage on its next attack roll against you. Once both attacks have been made, the power ends.

#### Saber Assault
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Saber Ward
- **Casting Time:** Special
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 round

The first time you take the Attack action during your turn, you can simultaneously cast this power to blend your melee weapon attacks with the use of the Force. For each successful hit you make with a melee weapon before the power ends, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw or have a new effect apply until the end of its next turn. Once you've made three weapon attacks, the power ends.

- **1st Hit:** If the target fails its saving throw, it gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn.
- **2nd Hit:** If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d6 kinetic damage and cannot take reactions until after the end of its next turn.
- **3rd Hit:** If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 2d6 kinetic damage and cannot take bonus actions during its next turn.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage of the second and third hit each increase by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 1st.

#### Saber Dance
_4th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Animate Weapon
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A light- or vibro-weapon of your choice that you are wearing or carrying begins to animate, spinning around your body at high speeds in a 10-foot radius centered on you. For the duration, your movement speed is halved, and the weapon moves with you.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d10 damage of the weapon's type, or half as much damage on a successful saving throw.

When this power ends, you can immediately recall the weapon to your hand.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the power increases to 15 feet, and the power's damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Saber Onslaught
_4th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Saber Strike
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 turn

You assume a battle stance. Until the end of your turn, your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. Additionally, whenever you move, you can make one melee weapon attack against each creature you move within 5 feet of for the first time this turn. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can choose to either knock the target prone, or push it 5 feet away from you.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 5th level or higher, the bonus weapon damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Saber Slash
_3rd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Saber Strike
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You move in a burst of speed to deliver a deadly blow. When you cast this power, you must be wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, otherwise, the power fails. As part of the action used to cast this power, you move in a straight line to an unoccupied space within the power's range and strike a creature within your weapon's range. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement have disadvantage. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage equal to three rolls of the weapon's damage dice + 4d4 force damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, the force damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Sense Shatterpoint
_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Battle Insight
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round

You seek deeper insight into the defenses of a creature you can see within range. Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on your next two attack rolls against the target.

#### Saber Strike
_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Saber Assault
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

As part of the action used to cast the power, you can move up to your speed and make one melee weapon attack. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon's type. In addition, if you hit with the attack, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus weapon damage increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

#### Tapas
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You use the Force to inure yourself to the elements. For the duration, you are considered adapted to hot and cold climates.

#### Telepathic Link
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Force Whisper
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You establish a telepathic link with one willing creature you touch. Until the power ends, whenever you and the target can see each other, each of you can communicate with the other via telepathy.

You don't need to share a language with a creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, and the creature understands you even if it lacks a language. The creature can respond to you telepathically as well, but it must understand at least one language in order to communicate this way. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases to concentration, up to 1 hour, and if either you or the creature you are linked to are surprised while the other isn't, and both of you can see each other, the surprised creature can still act normally on its first turn in combat, as if it were not surprised.

#### Vitality Shield
_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Force Body
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You siphon some of your own vitality to create a barrier in the Force around yourself. You take 2d8 true damage, and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the amount of damage you took. If this damage would reduce your hit points to 0, the power fails. While you have these temporary hit points, you have advantage on Strength, Dexterity and Constitution saving throws. Any remaining temporary hit points are lost when this power ends.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the true damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Wakefulness
_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Breath Control

- You do not need to eat, drink, or sleep. You can't be forced to sleep by any means. To gain the benefits of a long rest, you can spend all 8 hours doing light activity, such as reading and keeping watch. 

If you still have any levels of exhaustion when this power ends, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain one additional level of exhaustion.

#### Wall Run
_At-will universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 turn

Until the end of the turn, you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed and you have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Strength (Athletics) checks that involve movement. For the same duration, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces while leaving your hands free. This does not allow you to move upside down along ceilings. If you are on a vertical surface when you no longer have a climbing speed, you immediately fall unless you have some other means of remaining there.
