# Customization Options

T>he combination of ability scores, species, class, and background defines your character's capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who—with the GM's permission—want to go a step further.
This chapter expands on feats, which are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.

### Fighting Styles and Masteries
Wretched Hives introduces new ammunition types, such as the specialized power cells, or rockets. You'll want to extend the benefits of certain Fighting Styles and Fighting Masteries to these new munitions, as explained below.

#### Explosives Style and Mastery
You will want to extend the benefits of this pair to include charges.

## Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow—perhaps by a withering curse—you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.

Once you've used this feature on a creature, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
- Once per turn, when you cast a power that doesn't require an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, but requires a die roll, you can choose the maximum or minimum on the die (your choice). If the power requires rolling multiple dice, you can only affect a number of them equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up) in this way. Once you've used this feature on a power, you can't affect that power again until you complete a short or long rest.

This ends early if you are incapacitated or die.



## Companions
A companion is a creature who accompanies you on your adventures. It might take the form of a fearsome beast, a padawan learner, a droid sidekick, or a mischievous spirit. Some companions are an integral part of an archetype, while others are simple NPCs that characters encounter and adopt during their adventures.

> #### Companions In Your Game
> Companions are not for the faint of heart. They add a significant power boost to a party, and can really bog down your game if their player's are not prepared. You might choose to allow your players to use the companion archetypes, but not the feats, vice versa, both options, or none. It's up to you.
>
> ***Starting Equipment.*** Companions generally don't start with any equipment, so it's up to the player to gear their companion. For the sake of modesty, humanoid companion should probably start with a set of basic clothing, as appropriate.
>
> ***Downtime Activities.*** Companions should not be able to perform downtime activities separately from their player's character. However, companions should be able to help others perform their downtime activities. Additionally, a player can choose to have their companion perform a downtime activity, though their character must spend their downtime helping the companion.
>
> ***Encounter Building and Experience Allocation.*** A companion's level matches that of their owner, so they do not need to gain experience. However, you should consider treating a companion as half a character when building encounters and distributing experience. For instance, if your party is three characters and one companion, you should generate encounters and divide experience gained 3.5 ways, instead of simply three ways.
>
> ***Enhanced Items.*** Companions should not count towards party size when allocating enhanced items. Additionally, while companion classes share names with their player character class counterparts, companions can not attune to items that require that class.
>
> ***Starships and Deployments.*** Companions can not deploy as pilots, though they can fill other deployments as normal. Additionally, companions can gain deployment ranks, though they accrue prestige at half the rate of player characters, and they can not exceed 4 ranks in a deployment.

### Gaining a Companion
Certain archetypes, such as the Astrotech Engineer, Saboteur Operative, or Zoologist Scholar, have their companions as the focus of their archetype's features. Alternatively, a companion can be gained through taking the Companion Keeper feat, detailed later in this chapter.

Regardless of how a companion is obtained, each player may have no more than one companion at a given time.





### Generating Your Companion
First, you should determine your companion's nature and appearance, as determined by your archetype feature or chosen from the list of companion natures if you take the Companion Keeper feat. Second, allocate your companion's ability scores, as determined by its nature. Finally, you should generate your companion from 1st level using the follower class, and increase its level one level at a time, until its level equals your own. Be sure to update your companion's hit points, ability scores, proficiency bonus, and any features it gains as it levels.

#### Companion Nature
Your companion's nature, discussed later in this chapter, is determined by your archetype feature or companion feat. Your companion's nature determines its type, its hit points and Hit Dice, its proficiencies and other features, and its companion traits. At 1st level, your companion starts with two traits. It gains additional traits when it reaches higher levels, as shown in the follower table.

#### Class and Features
Your companion gains features when it reaches certain levels, as shown in the follower table.

#### Leveling Your Companion
Your companion's level equals your own, and each time you gain a level, so does your companion. 

#### Proficiency Bonus
Your companion's proficiency bonus is equal to that of a player character of the same level, as shown in the follower table.

> #### Starting Equipment
> Generally speaking, companions are not intended to start with any equipment; it is up to you to outfit them as you deem appropriate. Humanoid companions should probably at least have clothing, however.

### Companions in Combat
In combat, companions generally behave as a player character would, with the following differences.

#### Actions in Combat
Unless you use your bonus action to direct your companion, your companion can only use its action to Dash, Dodge, Disengage, Guard, or Hide.

#### Companion Initiative
Both you and your companion roll initiative, but you act together on the lesser of the two results. You act on one turn, and you can each move or take actions in any order.





## Companion Natures
Certain class features grant a specific companion nature, while the Companion Keeper feat offers your choice of companion nature. You must meet a companion nature's requirement in order to choose that companion. You may only have one active companion at a time.

> #### Alternative Companion Nature
> Your archetype feature may grant you one type of companion, whereas your character can be better realized utilizing a different companion. For instance, an astrotech engineer might prefer to have a tracker droid over one of the larger droid options. Work with your GM to determine if a different companion is better suited, and mechanically appropriate, to your character's identity. 

You may choose your companion's nature from the following options or roll on the table below to determine it randomly. 



|d10|Companion Nature|
|:--:|:--|
|1|Aberrant|
|2|Beast|
|3|Droid|
|4|Humanoid|
|5|Spirit|
|6|Thrall|
|7|Tracker Droid|
|8|Turret|



If you determine your companion's nature randomly, and the result is a nature for which you are ineligible, simply reroll until you get a proper result.

If your companion is irreparably destroyed, or you want a different companion, you must first break the bond with your current companion. Bonding with a new companion takes 8 hours spent in an appropriate location. You may only have one companion at a time. If you want to change your companion nature, as with the Alternative Companions feature above.

## Beast Companion 
Your beast takes a form of your choosing. Alternatively, your GM can choose what form your beast takes based on your environment. Once you've chosen your beast's appearance, you assign your beast companion's ability scores. Your beast's Intelligence score is 6, and you assign its other ability scores using a standard array (16, 14, 12, 10, 8) as you see fit.

### Ranger's Quarry
Also at 3rd level, your companion learns how to effectively read and track its prey. Once on each of its turns, your companion can choose a creature it can see within 120 feet and mark it as its quarry (no action 





required). For the next hour, your companion gains the following benefits:
- Once per turn, when your companion hits the target with a weapon attack, it can deal 1d4 additional damage to it of the same type as the weapon's damage. This die increases to a d6 at 7th level and a d8 at 15th level.
- Your companion has advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check it makes to find the target while it's on the same planet as your companion.

Your companion can only have one creature marked in this way at a time. Beginning at 11th level, your companion can use its reaction to mark a creature when it enters its line of sight, provided it is within range of your companion's Ranger's Quarry.

### Commando
At 15th level, your companion can take the Dash or Hide actions as a bonus action on each of its turns. Additionally, it can remain perfectly still for long periods of time to set up ambushes.

When your companion attempts to hide on its turn, it can opt to not move on that turn. If it avoids moving, creatures that attempt to detect it take a -10 penalty to their Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your companion's next turn. Your companion loses this benefit if it moves or falls prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. It is still automatically detected if any effect or action causes it to no longer be hidden.

If your companion is still hidden on its next turn, it can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until it is detected.

Additionally, your companion can no longer be tracked by unenhanced means, unless it chooses to leave a trail.
