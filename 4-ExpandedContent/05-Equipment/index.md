## Exotic Weapons


A new weapon tier succeeding simple and martial weapons, exotic weapons introduce new special weapons with unique capacities that can not be achieved by simple or martial weapons.

### Proficiency
In order to gain proficiency in an exotic weapon, you must first have proficiency in all simple and martial weapons within that category. For instance, before you can be come proficient with an exotic blaster, you would first need to be proficient in all simple and martial blasters. For modal exotics (discussed below), if the exotic has modes that would fall in two different weapon categories, you require proficiency all simple and martial weapons in both categories in order to gain proficiency in that exotic.

### Types of Exotic Weapons
Exotic weapons come in two major types: modal and specialized.

#### Modal Exotics
Modal exotics have the capacity to switch between modes, with each mode utilizing the damage and properties of an existing weapon, as indicated by the weapons included with the property. Switching between each mode can be achieved by using a character's object interaction on their turn.

> #### Combination Weapons
> This rule allows characters to combine lightweapons with other lightweapons and vibroweapons with other vibroweapons, granting modes that can be switched between on a character's turn by using their object interaction. Blasters, on the other hand, can gain an attachment that lets them load wrist launcher ammunition in addition to their base ammunition, granting them some limited additional effects.
>
> Modal exotics instead allow a blaster to have multiple modes that a character can switch between using their object interaction. Modal lightweapons and vibroweapons can grant a mode of a different weapon type, still using that object interaction to switch between. For instance, a modal exotic vibroweapon could have a separate blaster or lightweapon mode, instead of a vibroweapon mode.
>
> Additionally, modal exotics count as a number of weapons equal to their modes when using the Combination Weapons rule. For instance, an IWS has three modes and thus would count as three weapons. Adding the wrist launcher attachment to it would require a DC 20 ability check, as appropriate, and a proficiency bonus of +4. The attachment would only have a reload property of 1, in this instance, since the total reload number of this attachment combined with the number of weapon modes should not exceed what the total number of combined weapons could be, per the Combination/Separation DC by Weapons table.



#### Specialized Exotics
Specialized exotics, on the other hand, bypass the inherent base and cap to a weapon property. For instance, a weapon with the keen 1 property could not bypass keen 3, per the rules of weapon modifications. A specialized exotic, on the other hand, could potentially start with the keen 2 property, and have up to the keen 4 property. A specialized exotic weapon must have that property in order to bypass its base and cap, and a specialized exotic cannot bypass the base and cap of more than one property.

***Biting.*** A specialized exotic lightweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.

***Bright.*** A specialized exotic lightweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.

***Brutal.*** A specialized exotic weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.

***Corrupting.*** A specialized exotic lightweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.

***Defensive.*** A specialized exotic light- or vibro-weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.

***Dire.*** A specialized exotic weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.

***Disintegrate.*** A specialized exotic blaster with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.

***Keen.*** A specialized exotic weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.

***Neuralizing.*** A specialized exotic vibroweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.

***Piercing.*** A specialized exotic weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.

***Shocking.*** A specialized exotic vibroweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.

***Smart.*** A specialized exotic blaster with this property gains a (+2, 0) bonus to its base and cap.

***Sonorous.*** A specialized exotic vibroweapon with this property gains a +2 bonus to its base and cap.

***Vicious.*** A specialized exotic weapon with this property gains a +1 bonus to its base and cap.

### Generating Exotics
Exotics can be generated just like weapons using the weapon calculator, with the following variations.

#### Modal
___
- **1.** Modal exotics take the highest weight of each its modes, and add half the weight of each of the other modes.
- **2.** Modal exotics combine the value of each of its modes.

#### Specialized
___
- **1.** Specialized exotics use the framework of a martial weapon of the appropriate category with an appropriate property.
- **2.** Specialized exotics adds the specialized property value and weight a second time.

### Exotic Weapon Chassis
For modal exotics, each mode has separate modification slots, with the exception of augments; augments are shared across all weapon modes. Specialized exotics function like non-exotic weapons.

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

#### Modal
A weapon with this property can switch between modes. A list of weapons in parentheses appears with the property-the weapons between which an exotic weapon can be switched by using an object interaction.

#### Specialized
A weapon with this property bypasses the base and cap of certain properties. Another weapon property in parentheses with the property-the weapon property that the exotic bypasses the base and cap for.

### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described below.

#### Atlatl
This specialized gungan club can be used to throw grenades or similar objects at long distances. If you are wielding this weapon, as part of the action to throw a grenade, you can instead throw it using an atlatl you are holding. The grenade can be thrown at a short distance of 30ft and a long distance of 120ft. When throwing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade’s explosion have advantage on the saving throw.  If you lack proficiency in the atlatl, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

#### ARC Caster
Whenever you deal damage with this weapon and roll the maximum on the weapon damage die, the creature hit becomes shocked until the end of its next turn.

#### Blaster Cannon
Rather than traditional power cells, the blaster cannon uses a specialized power generator that allows it to fire continuously for 10 minutes. Replacing a power generator takes an action.

Before firing the blaster cannon, you must deploy it using an action unless you meet its strength requirement. Alternatively, if you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this action replaces one of them.  While deployed in this way, you treat this weapon’s strength number as two steps less (from 19 to 15), your speed is reduced by half, and you cannot fire this weapon at long range. You can collapse the blaster cannon as an action or bonus action.

#### Bolas
A Large or smaller creature hit by a bolas is restrained until it is freed. A bolas has no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Dexterity check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The bolas has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons. Destroying the bolas frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the bolas’s effects. While a creature is restrained by a bolas, you can make no further attacks with it.

Due to their unwieldy nature, bolas make ineffective melee weapons. Melee attack rolls made with them are made at disadvantage.

#### Bolt-thrower
Rather than traditional power cells, the bolt-thrower fires specialized projectiles in the form of bolts.

#### Cesta
This specialized gungan staff can be used to throw grenades or similar objects at long distances. If you are wielding this weapon, as part of the action to throw a grenade, you can instead throw it using a cesta you are holding. The grenade can be thrown at a short distance of 60ft and a long distance of 240ft. When throwing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade’s explosion have advantage on the saving throw. If you lack proficiency in the cesta, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.

#### Compound Bow
Rather than traditional power cells, the compound bow fires specialized projectiles in the form of arrows. You can make a ranged weapon attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one arrow. 

Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

#### Heavy blaster Cannon
Rather than traditional power cells, the heavy blaster cannon uses a specialized power generator that allows it to fire continuously for 10 minutes. Replacing a power generator takes an action.

Before firing the blaster cannon, you must deploy it using an action unless you meet its strength requirement. Alternatively, if you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this action replaces one of them.  While deployed in this way, you treat this weapon’s strength number as two steps less (from 19 to 15), your speed is reduced by half, and you cannot fire this weapon at long range. You can collapse the heavy blaster cannon as an action or bonus action.

#### Lightning Cannon
Whenever you deal damage with this weapon and roll the maximum on the weapon damage die, the creature hit becomes shocked until the end of its next turn.

#### Lightning Rifle
Whenever you deal damage with this weapon and roll the maximum on the weapon damage die, the creature hit becomes shocked until the end of its next turn.

#### Mancatcher
When you would make a Strength (Athletics) check to attempt to grapple a creature while wielding a weapon with the grappling property, you can instead make a melee weapon attack with it. If the attack hits, the creature becomes grappled by you, and it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier of the same type as the weapon’s damage.

#### Mortar Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the mortar launcher fires grenades. If you lack proficiency in the mortar launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total. A mortar launcher cannot fire on targets within its short range and when firing a grenade at long range, creatures within the radius of the grenade’s explosion do not have advantage on the saving throw. Additionally, when you launch a mortar at a target, you can treat the Weapon's point of origin as being 200ft in the air for the purposes of determining line of sight and cover.

The mortar launcher requires the use of a tripod, which is included in the price. Over the course of 1 minute, you can deploy or collapse the mortar launcher on the tripod. While deployed, your speed is reduced to 0.

#### Needler
The needler includes a specialized compartment for poison. One dose of poison, when installed in this compartment, retains its potency for 1 hour before drying. One dose of poison is effective for the next 10 shots fired by the weapon.

#### Retrosaber
The retrosaber is an ancient type of lightweapon that requires a power cell to function. Once four attacks have been made with a retrosaber, a character must replace the power cell using an action or bonus action. You must have one free hand to replace the power cell.

#### Rocket Rifle
Rather than traditional power cells, the rocket rifle fires specialized projectiles in the form of small missiles.

#### Sentry Gun
Before firing the sentry gun, you must deploy it using an action unless you meet its strength requirement. Alternatively, if you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this action replaces one of them.  While deployed in this way, you treat this weapon’s strength number as two steps less (from 19 to 15), your speed is reduced by half, and you cannot fire this weapon at long range. You can collapse the sentry gun as an action or bonus action.

#### Shortbow
Rather than traditional power cells, the shortbow fires specialized projectiles in the form of arrows. You can make a ranged weapon attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one arrow. 

Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

#### Torpedo Launcher
Rather than traditional power cells, the torpedo launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of torpedoes. Torpedo launchers have advantage on attack rolls against Gargantuan creatures and disadvantage on attack rolls against Large and smaller creatures. Unlike other weapons, the torpedo launcher can only be loaded using an action, and you don’t add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls you make with it.

The torpedo launcher requires the use of a tripod, which is included in the price. Over the course of 1 minute, you can deploy or collapse the torpedo launcher on the tripod. While deployed, your speed is reduced to 0.

#### Tranquilizer Rifle
The tranquilizer rifle includes a specialized compartment for poison. One dose of poison, when installed in this compartment, retains its potency for 1 hour before drying. One dose of poison is effective for the next 4 shots fired by the weapon. Additionally, creatures reduced to 0 hit points by this weapon are immediately stabilized, unless that damage would instantly kill them.

#### Vibro-lance
You have disadvantage when you use a vibrolance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.



## Adventuring Gear
This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

### Ammunition

On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 sonic damage and is deafened until the end of its next turn. Once the arrow hits a target, it no longer gives a bonus.

#### Arrow, Electroshock
An electroshock arrow is a specialized arrow for use with bow weapons. When you hit a creature with this arrow, the creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d3 ion damage and becomes stunned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t stunned. Once the arrow hits a target, it no longer gives a bonus.

#### Bolt
This Bolt-thrower ammunition deals 2d6 kinetic damage on a hit. When you would use poison to coat a weapon or slug cartridge you can instead coat a bolt with the poison.

#### Bolt, Deafening
This bolt-thrower ammunition deals 2d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Also on a hit, the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d4 sonic damage on a failed save.
Additionally, on a failed save, a creature is deafened for 1 minute. At the end of an affected creature’s turn, it can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.

#### Bolt, Electrifying
This bolt-thrower ammunition deals 2d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Also on a hit, the creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d4 lightning damage on a failed save.

#### Bolt, Panic
This bolt-thrower ammunition deals 2d6 kinetic damage on a hit. Also on a hit, the creature must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, taking 2d4 psychic damage on a failed save.
Additionally, on a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. At the start of an affected creature’s turn, it can repeat this save, ending the effect on a success.

#### Fragmentation Torpedo
This torpedo launcher ammunition deals 20d4 kinetic damage on a hit. 

#### Plasma Torpedo
This torpedo launcher ammunition deals 20d4 energy damage on a hit. 

### Explosives

#### Charge, Fragmentation
A device used to blow holes in larger constructs and structures, a breaching charge creates a devastating explosion focused in a specific direction. Installing a breaching charge takes 1 minute. The charge can be set with a 6-second timer, or detonated remotely using a remote detonator.

When detonated, the breaching charge explodes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 20d4 kinetic damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If affixed to a creature, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. Objects, structures, and other surfaces have disadvantage on the saving throw. If affixed to the object, structure, or surface, it instead automatically fails this saving throw.

The raft is 6 feet long and 3 feet wide, and can hold up to four Medium creatures not exceeding 800 lb. It comes with two collapsible oars with which to row. The raft can be collapsed and restored over the course of 1 minute.

#### Emergency Rations (One day's)
Emergency rations come in small pill form, provide all the necessary nourishment for one person for one day, and take up roughly one-tenth the space of field rations. 

#### Environmental Suits
Environmental suits are heavy duty completely sealed suits that can be worn over other clothing and armor. Each suit is tailored to a certain environment, and has no effect on environments to which it is not tailored. Due to their encompassing and cumbersome nature, while wearing an environmental suit, a creature's speed is reduced by 15. Environmental suits include 8 hours' capacity of oxygen, which can be replenished by an oxygen tank or directly connected to a source of oxygen such as a life support system on a vehicle or starship.

***Chemical Suit.*** Chemical suits are sealed suits that repel corrosive acids. While wearing a chemical suit, you have resistance to acid damage, and you are immune to the corroded condition.

***Conductive Suit.*** Conductive suits help prevent electrocution by grounding electrical sources. While wearing a conductive suit, you have resistance to lightning damage, and you are immune to the shocked condition.

***Dampening Suit.*** Dampening suits modulate sounds that come from outside the suit. While wearing a dampening suit, you have resistance to sonic damage, you are immune to the deafened condition, and you can't have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sound.

***Diving Suit.*** Diving suits are sealed suits that help regulate body temperature while underwater. While wearing a diving suit, you have resistance to cold damage, and are protected from the hazards associated with high pressure environments.

***Flame-Proof Suit.*** Flame-proof suits prevent flames from reaching the wearer's body. While wearing a flame-proof suit, you have resistance to fire damage, and you are immune to the ignited condition.

***Hazard Suit.*** Hazard suits are made to seal the wearer away from noxious gases. While wearing a hazard suit, you have resistance to poison damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.

***Mind-Shielding Suit.*** Mind-shielding suits help protect the wearer's mind—and body—from outside influence. While wearing a mind-shielding suit, you have resistance to psychic damage, you have advantage on saving throws to avoid being frightened, and you have advantage on saving throws to avoid having your mind read or affected.

***Stabilizer Suit.*** Stabilizer suits help to keep the bearer from being battered by powerful forces. While wearing a stabilizer suit, you have resistance to force damage, and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being moved.

***Space Suit.*** Space suits are suits that enabled wearers to survive and operate in the vacuum of space. While wearing a space suit, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and are protected from the hazards associated with low pressure environments.

#### Oxygen Tank
Oxygen tanks include 8 hours' capacity of oxygen. They can be connected to an environmental suit or respirator to feed it directly or replenish any reduced capacity at a rate of one hour's oxygen per ten minutes connected. Only one oxygen tank can be connected at a time.

### Storage

#### Bucket
A bucket stores 3 gallons of liquid or 1/2 cubic foot of solids.

#### Flask
A flask stores 1 pint of liquid.

### Utilities

#### Fire Extinguisher
As an action, you can expend a use of the extinguisher to create a 15 foot cone of misty air which lasts for 6 seconds, snuffing out any unenhanced fires within range. Additionally, each creature within range must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the start of their next turn. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this effect. An extinguisher can be used 5 times before it must be replenished at its original cost.

#### Gravity Generator
Gravity generators are special devices typically worn on belts that function as a portable, personal artificial gravity source. Activating or deactivating the belt requires a bonus action and, while active, you are able to move as if in a standard gravitational pull. The generator lasts for 10 minutes and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cell.

### Weapon and Armor Accessories

#### Ammo Pouch
An ammo pouch is a small pouch, usually worn around the waist or chest, which holds 20 slug cartridges. When you reload a weapon, you can draw as much ammunition needed from this pouch without using an object interaction to do so. Instead of slug cartridges, you can instead store a power cell which takes up the space of 10 cartridges.

#### Propulsion Pack
Propulsion packs enhance underwater movement. Activating or deactivating the propulsion pack requires a bonus action and, while active, you have a swimming speed of 30 feet. The propulsion pack lasts for 1 minute per power cell (to a maximum of 10 minutes) and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cells.

Activating or deactivating the repulsor pack requires a bonus action and, while active, your rate of descent slow to 60 feet per round, and you ignore the effects of wind of less than moderate speed (no more than 10 mph). The repulsor pack lasts for 1 minute per power cell (to a maximum of 10 minutes) and can be recharged by a power source or replacing the power cells.

#### Shock Gloves
A shock glove is a type of armored glove that is coated with a webbed lacing. When used for an attack, this webbing carries a charge that deals 1d4 lightning damage to any objects that the glove come in contact with. If you are engaged in combat with the target of the attack, you must make a grapple check instead of an attack roll, using a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).

## Droids
One common way to spend wealth is to purchase droids. Some droids are built for scouting, while others offer advanced skillsets. Protocol droids help communicate with foreign bodies, and combat droids can help supplement a budding force. The Droids table offers some choices for purchase.

|Droid Designation|Cost|

|:--|--:|
|3PO Series Protocol Droid|5,500 cr|
|B1-A Battle Droid|1,300 cr|
|B1-X Battle Droid|2,600 cr|
|Destroyer Droid|84,000 cr|
|DUM Series Pit Droid|650 cr|
|ID9 Seeker Droid|150 cr|
|IG-86 Assassin Droid|22,400 cr|
|HK Series Assassin Droid|212,000 cr|
|R2 Series Astromech Droid|2,800 cr|

## Mounts and Vehicles
Mounts and vehicles are the two most common types of on-planet transport. 

### Mounts
A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's speed and base carrying capacity.

An animal pulling a cart or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.

Mounts other than those listed here are available in the worlds of *Star Wars*, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase, like aiwhas from Kamino. Acquiring such a mount is often an adventure in-and-of itself.

Mounts are governed by Animal Handling proficiency.

#### Barding
Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight of barding varies based on the size of the creature, as shown in the Tack, Harness, and Drawn Vehicles table.

#### Saddles
A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding an exotic mount.



##### Mounts and Other Animals

|	Wagon		                |	350 cr	|	400.00 lb	|	

### Vehicles
Vehicles are more common on civilized planets than animal mounts. Vehicles do not have access to barding and do not require saddles. Vehicles vary greatly based on price, speed, carrying capacity, personnel capacity, and armaments (if any). Below are some base costs for standard types of speeders. Vehicles are governed by Piloting proficiency.

##### Vehicles

|	Item	    	|	Cost	    |	Speed	|
|	:--	        	|	--:	        |	--:	    |
|   Airspeeder      |  14,500 cr    |   750 mph |
|   Landspeeder     |  10,000 cr    |   220 mph |
