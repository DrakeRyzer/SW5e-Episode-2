You can use an action to expend a superiority die. When you do so, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage for each attack it makes until the start of your next turn.

You can expend one superiority die to make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check as a bonus action, adding the superiority die to the check.

You can use a bonus action to expend a superiority die. When you do so, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and on its turn must use its movement to move half its speed in a random direction. Roll a d8 and assign a direction to each face. If the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes the minimum damage the attack could have dealt plus additional damage equal to the result of the superiority die.

#### Deliberate Movement

#### Sic 'Em

_**Prerequisite:** Companion_<br>
Whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) or a Wisdom (Survival) check, you can request the aid of your companion by expending a superiority die, adding the number rolled to the check.

#### Wracking Torment
_**Mental maneuver**_<br>
When a hostile creature you can see within 30 feet would take damage from an effect you or a friendly creature controls, you can use your reaction and expend a superiority die to temporarily weaken their resilience against it.
