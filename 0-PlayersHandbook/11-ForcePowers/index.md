#### Affect Mind
_At-will universal power_<br>
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a target within range that isn't hostile toward you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at that target. 

On a successful save, the creature does not realize that you tried to use the Force to influence its mood, but it becomes immune to this power for one day. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

#### Affliction
_2nd-level dark side power_

___
- **Prerequisite:** Slow
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a creature that you can see within range. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target gains 1 slowed level, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a power with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the power doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the power. If it can't, the power is wasted.	

The creatures makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends.

#### Animate Weapon
_2nd-level universal power_
___ 
- **Prerequisite:** Force Disarm
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You select a light- or vibro-weapon within this power's range that is not worn or carried by a conscious creature other than you, and use the Force to cause it to levitate, acting as an extension of your will for the duration or until you cast this power again. When you use this power, you can cause the weapon to move up to 20 feet and make a melee force attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 + your forcecasting ability modifier damage. The type is of the normal damage dealt by the weapon.

While the weapon is animated, on each of your turns you can use a bonus action to move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. At any time, you can end this force power to return the animated weapon to your hand.

An enemy can attempt to gain control of the weapon by using its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your force save DC. On a success, the creature gains control of the weapon and the power ends.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, the weapon's damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

#### Armor of Abeloth
_1st-level dark side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 hour 

A protective force surrounds you, manifesting as shimmering light that covers you and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 psychic damage.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary hit points and the psychic damage increase by 5 for each slot.

#### Aura of Purity
_4th-level light side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Restoration
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 

Purifying energy radiates from you in a 30-foot radius. Until the power ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) can't become diseased, has resistance to poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws against effects that cause any of the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned. 

#### Aura of Vigor
_3rd-level light side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Valor
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Envigorating energy radiates from you in a 30-foot radius. Until the power ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) deals an extra 1d4 damage with weapon attacks.

#### Battle Insight
_At-will universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round

You center your focus on a target within range. Through the Force, you gain a brief insight into the target's defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this power hasn't ended.

This power benefits additional attacks at higher levels: two attacks at 5th level, three attacks at 11th level, and four attacks at 17th level.

#### Battle Meditation
_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (5-foot radius)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You exude an aura out to 5 feet that boosts the morale and overall battle prowess of you and your allies while simultaneously reducing the opposition's combat-effectiveness by eroding their will to fight. 

Whenever you or a friendly creature within your meditation makes an attack roll or a saving throw, they can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw. 

Whenever a hostile creature enters your meditation or starts its turn there, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from each attack roll or saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. On a successful save, it is immune to this power for 1 day.

#### Battle Precognition
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 8 hours

Your attunement to the Force warns you when you are about to enter danger. Until the power ends, your base AC becomes 13 + your Dexterity modifier. This power has no effect if you are wearing armor.

#### Beacon of Hope 
_3rd-level light side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Heroism 
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 30 feet 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This power bestows hope and vitality. Choose any number of creatures within range. For the duration, each target has advantage on Wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and regains the maximum number of hit points possible from any healing.

#### Beast Trick
_1st-level light side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 24 hours

This power lets you distract a beast. Choose a beast that you can see within range. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the power fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the power's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the power ends.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.



#### Bestow Curse
_3rd-level dark side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Curse
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the power. When you cast this power, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:
- Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
- While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. lf it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
- While the target is cursed, your attacks and powers deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

A remove curse power ends this effect. At the GM's discretion, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse's effect. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** If you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a force slot of 5th Level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a force slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level force slot, the power lasts until it is dispelled. Using a force slot of 5th Level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require concentration.

#### Breath Control
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You are able to slow your metabolism in such a way that you can stop breathing and resist the effect of toxins in your body. If you are poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If more than one poison afflicts you, you neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

For the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, resistance to poison damage, and you no longer need to breathe.





#### Burst
_At-will universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (5-foot sphere)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous	 

You cause the earth to burst from beneath your feet. Each creature within range, other than you, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 kinetic damage.

This power's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Burst of Speed
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** 1 hour 

You touch a creature. The target's speed increases by 10 feet until the power ends.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

#### Call Lightning
_3rd-level light side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

As you align yourself with nature through the Force, a 10-foot tall, 60-foot radius storm cloud cylinder appears, centered on a point you can see within range above you, with you as the center point. The power fails if your location can't accommodate the cloud's size or height. When you cast the power, choose a point under the cloud for lightning to strike. Each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity save, taking 3d10 lightning damage on a fail and half on a success. While the power persists, you can use your action to call lightning to a point in range again.

If you're outdoors and in a storm, the power gives you control of the storm rather than creating a new one. The lightning damage also increases by 1d10.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Calm Emotions
_2nd-level light side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Sense Emotion
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.





- You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this power ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime. 
- You can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a power or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. 

When the power ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.

#### Choke
_3rd-level dark side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You make a constricting gesture at a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save target takes 5d8 force damage and is restrained until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and is not restrained.

You can use a bonus action while the target is restrained to move the target up to 5 feet in any direction.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Cloud Mind
_1st-level light side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this power can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose are affected in order of their current hit points.

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this power falls unconscious. If the power ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action wake the sleeper, they will be awoken.

Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, you can roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st. 





#### Coerce Mind
_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Affect Mind
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours 

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and influence with the Force a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you.  Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to harm itself automatically negates the effect of the power.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a soldier give her speeder to the first vagrant she meets. If the condition isn't met before the power expires, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the power ends. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

#### Comprehend Speech
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear.

#### Control Pain
_5th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Force Body
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You use the Force to push your body beyond its normal limits. You can't die from damage or from failed death saving throws while this power is in effect, but the effort taxes you. If you have 0 hit points while you are under the effect of this power, you do not fall unconscious, and continue acting and fighting normally. While you remain at 0 hit points, you must make a death saving throw at the start of each of your turns. Each time you fail a death saving throw, you suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws (including death saving throws). This penalty lasts until you regain hit points. Successful death saving throws have no effect, but a natural 20 restores 1 hit point as usual. 

If you have 0 hit points when this power ends, you die instantly.



#### Convulsion
_3rd-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Tremor
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d12 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Crush
_6th-level dark side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Choke
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

A beast you can see must succeed on a Wisdom save or be charmed. If you or your companions are fighting it, it has advantage on this saving throw.

While it's charmed, you have a telepathic link to it if you're on the same planet. You can use this link to issue commands while you are conscious, no action required, which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action. If it completes the order and doesn't receive further orders, it focuses on defending itself.

You can use your action to take total control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the beast takes only the actions you decide and nothing you don't allow it to. You can also have the beast use a reaction, but this takes your reaction as well.

If the beast takes damage, it makes another Wisdom save. On a success, the power ends.

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.







Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the power. If the saving throw succeeds, the power ends. 

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a 6th-level force slot, the duration is 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level force slot, the duration is 1 hour. When you use a force slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours.

You attempt to manipulate a creature into fighting you. One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your demands. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this power doesn't restrict the target's movement for that turn.

#### Earthquake
_8th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Eruption
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 500 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken.

When you cast this power and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. 

This power can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.

***Fissures.*** Fissures open throughout the power's area at the start of your next turn after you cast the power. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the power's area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).

***Structures.*** The tremor deals 50 kinetic damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the power and at the start of each of your turns until the power ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 kinetic damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape.

- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10 - foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save. 

If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 kinetic damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the power's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.

Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can't see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this power is blinded until the power ends. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for the creature to be affected.

When you cast the power, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this power on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the effect lasts until it is dispelled.

***False Aura.*** You change the way the target appears to powers and Force-based enhanced effects, such as *sense force*, that detects the presence of the Force. You can make a Force-based unenhanced object or creature appear enhanced and to radiate a Force aura, or a Force-based enhanced object or creature appear unenhanced and to radiate no Force aura. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false aura apparent to any creature that handles the item.

This power has no effect on droids or constructs.





#### Force Mask
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Mind Trick
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 hour

Until the power ends or you use an action to dismiss it, you can disguise yourself through use of the Force in many ways. You can appear to be shorter or taller by about a foot and change the appearance of your body and weight, but you cannot change the basic structure of your body. This effect can include your clothes, weapons, and other belongings on your person.

This effect is only visual, so any sort of physical contact will only interact with the real size and shape of you. A creature that uses its action to examine you can identify this effect with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force save DC. 

#### Force Meld
_5th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Force Whisper
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Droids, constructs, and creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this power.

Until the power ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can't extend beyond a single planet.

#### Force Mend
_7th-level light side power_
___

#### Force Project
_7th-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the power ends. 

You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

#### Force Propel
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Force Push/Pull
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one or more creatures or objects not being worn or carried within 60 feet that weigh up to a combined total of 15 pounds.

If the creatures or objects collide with any one target during its travel, both the creatures or objects and the target take 3d8 kinetic damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes the kinetic damage, or half as much on a successful one.

Alternatively, you can push or pull a creature or object you can see. 

You use the Force to move a Medium or smaller creature or object not being worn or carried within range. The target must make a Strength saving throw. An object automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed save, the creature or object moves a number of feet in a direction of your choice based on its size. A Tiny creature or object can be moved up to 20 feet, a Small creature or object can be moved up to 10 feet, and a Medium creature or object can be moved up to 5 feet.

Choose one creature, object, or force effect within range. Any force power of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each force power of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your forcecasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the power's level. On a success, the power ends.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a force power on the target if the power's level is equal to or less than the level of the force slot you used.

- **Range:** Varies
- **Duration:** 1 round

You imbue your weapon with the purifying light of the Force.

On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes wreathed in a glowing barrier of force energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves before then, it immediately takes 1d8 force damage, and the power ends.

This power's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.

If a target remains unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this power again until it finishes a long rest. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.

_2nd-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You receive a vision of the future through the Force, giving you or one willing creature you can see within range a chance to change fate. When the chosen creature makes an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw before the power ends, it can dismiss this power on itself to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can dismiss this power on itself to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled. 

If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls the additional d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Greater Heal
_6th-level light side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Improved Heal
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet

#### Greater Saber Throw
_5th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Improved Saber Throw
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

As a part of the action used to cast this power, you must make a ranged force attack with a lightweapon or vibroweapon against one target within the power's range, otherwise the power fails. On a hit, the target takes 6d8 damage of the same type as the weapon's damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against an additional effect depending on your choice of casting ability:

***Wisdom.*** The target takes an additional 4d6 force damage and it gains four levels of slowed until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and its speed isn't reduced.

***Charisma.*** The target takes an additional 4d6 necrotic damage and cannot regain hit points until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and its healing capability is unaffected.

The weapon then immediately returns to your hand.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 6th level or higher, the force or necrotic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above 5th.

#### Guidance
_At-will light side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature. Once before the power ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. The power then ends.

This power's die increases at higher levels: to a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 11th level, and a d10 at 17th level.

#### Hallucination
_2nd-level dark side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You craft a dangerous illusion in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

The hallucination includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the hallucination with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your force power save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the hallucination is an illusion, and the power ends.





While a target is affected by the power, the target treats the hallucination as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the hallucination. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the hallucination's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A hallucination created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a hallucination created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the hallucination can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the hallucination's area or within 5 feet of the hallucination, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force power slot of 3rd level or higher, the range increases by 20 feet, the image dimensions increase by 5 feet, and you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 2nd.

#### Heroism
_1st-level light side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

When the power ends, the target loses any remaining temporary hit points from this power. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

While frightened by this power, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest 

available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the power ends for that creature.

Whenever a hostile creature enters your meditation or starts its turn there, it must make a Charisma saving throw.

On a successful save, it is immune to this power for 1 day.

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 15-foot radius around you and remains for the duration. The barrier moves with you.

Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to harm itself automatically negates the effect of the power.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the power ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn't met before the power ends, the activity isn't performed. If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this power, the power ends for that creature. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a 7th-level force slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level force slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level force slot, the duration is a year and a day.

- **Prerequisite:** Improved Force Immunity
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A 10-foot-radius faintly shimmering barrier surrounds you. Within the sphere, powers can't be cast and enhanced items become mundane. Until the power ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Powers and other enhanced effects are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed power is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

***Targeted Effects.*** Powers and other enhanced effects that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

***Enhanced Areas.*** The area of another power or enhanced effect, such as _force storm_, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an enhanced area, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.





***Powers.*** Any active power or other enhanced effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.

***Enhanced Items.*** The properties and powers of enhanced items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 vibrosword in the sphere functions as an unenhanced vibrosword.

An enhanced weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If an enhanced weapon or a piece of enhanced ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire an enhanced shot or throw an enhanced saberspear at a target outside the sphere), the enhancement of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.

***Enhanced Travel.*** Teleportation fails to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such enhanced travel. A portal to another location temporarily closes while in the sphere.

***Creatures and Objects.*** A creature or object summoned or created by powers temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.

***Tech Override/Sever Force.*** Powers and enhanced effects such as *sever force* have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different scrambling field powers don't nullify each other.

The affected creature must use all of its movement to writhe in discomfort without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this power, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, an affected creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the power ends. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.

#### Master Revitalize

Each creature in a line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 damage of the same type as the weapon's damage and 5d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You might cause the target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, a storm of blaster-fire, or deadly toxic gas, for example. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can't see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the power's duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 10d10 psychic damage, and the power ends.

The target is blinded and incapacitated, and its speed drops to 0. The target has resistance to all damage except psychic damage.

#### Telekinetic Wave
_8th-level light side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Telekinetic Burst
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 

You manipulate the Force in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 force damage, is knocked prone, and moved 5 feet in a direction of your choice. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone or moved.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 9th level, the damage increases by 2d6.

#### Telemetry
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the power. If it is an enhanced or modified item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any powers are affecting the item and what they are.

If the item was created by a power, you learn which power created it. If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what force powers, if any, are currently affecting it.

#### Tremor
_1st-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Burst
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d8 kinetic damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

#### True Sight
_6th-level universal power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Force Sight
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 hour 

You shift your vision to see through use of the Force, 





giving you the ability to see things as they actually are. For the duration, you have truesight and notice secret doors hidden by powers, all out to a range of 120 feet.

#### Turbulence
_At-will light side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one creature, or choose two creatures that are within 5 feet of each other, within range. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 force damage.

This power's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th, 11th, and 17th level.

#### Valor 
_1st-level light side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Resistance
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 30 feet 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the power ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power with a force slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 1st. When you cast this power at 3rd, 6th, or 9th level, the die increases to d6, d8, and d10, respectively.

#### Wall of Light
_6th-level light side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure an immense manifestation of destructive light side Force energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover and its space is difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 force damage, or half as much on a success.

#### Whirlwind
_7th-level universal power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the power ends, you can use your action to move 





the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.

A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the power ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the power ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.

A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your force save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6x10 feet away from it in a random direction.

#### Will of the Force
_9th-level light side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You sublimate yourself before the will of the Force, attempting to use it to affect change in the galaxy around you. 

The basic use of this power is to duplicate any other light side or universal force power of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that power; it simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:
- You summon one object to you of up to 250,000 cr in value that isn't an enhanced item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the *improved restoration* power.
- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single power or other specific enhanced effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to the Manifestation of Abeloth's Will ability.
- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, *will of the force* could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude 



in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This power might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary enhanced item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.

The stress of casting this power to produce any effect other than duplicating another power weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a power until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that power, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. Additionally, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Additionally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast *will of the force* ever again if you suffer this stress. Finally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points as a result of this necrotic damage, or at any point before you have fully recovered from the Strength reduction, you immediately die and cannot be resurrected as your body fades away, absorbed into the living Force.

#### Wound
_1st-level dark side power_
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You make a piercing gesture at a creature within range. Make a ranged force attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 necrotic damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.

***Force Potency.*** When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Wrack
_6th-level dark side power_
___
- **Prerequisite:** Plague
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You wrack the body of a creature that you can see with a virulent, disease-like condition. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal immediately.

***Force Potency.*** If you cast this power using a force slot of 7th level or higher, the power deals an extra 2d6 damage for each slot level above 6th.
