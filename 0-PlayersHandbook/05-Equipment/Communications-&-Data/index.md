## Communications

|**Item**|**Cost**|**Weight**|
|:--|--:|--:|
| Commlink              |   50 cr       |	0.50 lb		|
| Commlink, hands-free  |   200 cr      |	1.00 lb		|
| Comm jammer           |   450 cr      |	3.00 lb		|
| Holocomm              |   300 cr      |	2.00 lb		|
| Holotrace device      |   1,000 cr	|	5.00 lb		|
| Pocket scrambler      |   800 cr      |   1.00 lb		|

### Commlink
Commlinks are simple handheld communication devices, fitted with microphones and receivers. Basic, personal commlinks have a range of up to 30 miles, but are reduced in dense, urban areas or areas of high level interference. The commlink lasts for 10 hours and can be recharged by connecting to a power source or by replacing the power cell.

### Commlink, Hands-Free
A hands-free commlink functions as a commlink, but can be installed in a helmet or worn independently, such as on your head or ear.

### Comm Jammer
A device used to scramble and block transmissions from communications devices in a 300 foot radius. The device can be activated or deactivated as an action. Any creature sending incoming or outgoing communications within range must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a failure, their communications are jammed until the comm jammer is deactivated or they move out of its range. The comm jammer lasts for 1 hour and can be recharged by connecting to a power source or by replacing the power cell.

### Holocomm
A holocomm is a communications unit that utilizes the HoloNet. It enables users to send and receive messages through holographic-based transmission networks.

### Holotrace Device
A holotrace device is a wrist-worn gadget that can be used to trace a holographic transmission back to its source.

### Pocket Scrambler
A pocket scrambler is a simple add-on to any commlink that automatically encodes any messages sent out. The transmitted message can only be read by a device equipped with a matched scrambler.

## Data Recording and Storage	
### Code Cylinder
Code cylinders are security devices in the shape of short cylinders that contain coded information about their bearers and grant them access to secure areas.

### Datacard
A datacard or data disk is a flat, hand-held device used in conjunction with a datapad to store information.

### Datacron   
A datacron is a type of holocron that can be accessed by non-Force-sensitives and are mainly used to store encrypted data. They are complete with an interactive projection to access the information.

### Datapad
A datapad is a small electronic device used for the input, storage and displaying of information. It features a holoprojective surface for 3D viewing. 

### Holocron
Holocrons are information-storage devices used by force wielders that contain ancient lessons or valuable information in holographic form. They appear as palm-sized, glowing polyhedrons of crystalline material and hardware, and can only be activated and used through the power of the Force.

### Holorecorder
A holorecorder is a device used to record and project holograms. Some droid models are equipped with internal holorecorders.

### Stylus Pen
A stylus pen is designed to write on both solid surfaces and touch screen interfaces.

### Wristpad
A wristpad is a harness with an integrated datapad and holoprojector interface that fits on the forearm and includes self-charging battery packs.
