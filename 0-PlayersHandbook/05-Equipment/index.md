# Equipment

The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts: Jawas peddling refurbished wares (or trying to steal from careless travelers), Ugnauts selling various technology scrap, Twi'lek armstechs and Mirialan synthweavers. In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to speeders and spaceships.		

For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a stronghold or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.

## Wealth
Wealth generally appears in the form of credits. The Galactic Republic and Sith Empire have their own mints, but in most worlds, the chits are interchangeable. Other trade goods, gemstones, artifacts, and property can reflect your character's financial well-being. Members of the lower class trade in goods, bartering for what they need and paying taxes in raw materials. Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or a company, or in high denomination credits. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in credits.

### Currency
Credits come in a variety of denominations: from a single chit to cards loaded with incredible value. While the Republic and Empire have their own currencies, in most worlds they can be used interchangeably.
 
With ten credits, a character can buy a power cell, a stylus, or a glowrod. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn ten credits a day. The credit is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the chit itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of credits, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual chits. Rather, the credit is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in credit cards, letters of credit, or valuable goods.			
 
A standard chit weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty chits weigh a pound.	

### Selling Treasure										
Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

#### Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment
As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Used weapons and armor aren't always in good enough condition to sell.										
    
#### Enhanced Items
Selling enhanced items can be problematic. Finding someone to find an overtuned blaster isn't hard, but the most unique of items are beyond all but the wealthiest denizens. Likewise, aside from a few common enhanced items, you won't normally come across enhanced items to purchase. The value of special equipment is far beyond simple credits and should always be treated as such.

#### Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects
These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for credits or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large city or even another planet.

#### Trade Goods
In the Outer Rim, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods-raw materials like bags of salt, livestock, and so on-retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.

### Wealth at Higher Levels
As characters progress to higher levels, there is an expectation of increased wealth, be it in the shape of coin or equipment. The below table serves as a target for how much each character should have earned at certain levels.

#### Wealth by Level

|**Level**|**Wealth**|**Level**|**Wealth**|
|:--:|--:|:--:|--:|
| 1st  | - | 11th | 175,000 cr|
| 2nd  | 1,000 cr| 12th | 250,000 cr|
| 3rd  | 2,500 cr| 13th | 350,000 cr|
| 4th  | 5,000 cr| 14th | 500,000 cr|
| 5th  | 10,000 cr|15th | 750,000 cr|
| 6th  | 20,000 cr| 16th | 1,250,000 cr|
| 7th  | 35,000 cr| 17th | 2,500,000 cr|
| 8th  | 50,000 cr| 18th | 5,000,000 cr|
| 9th  | 75,000 cr| 19th | 7,500,000 cr|
| 10th | 125,000 cr| 20th | 10,000,000 cr|

## Expenses					
When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.

### Lifestyle Expenses					
Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.

At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

#### Lifestyle Expenses

|**Lifestyle**|**Price/Day**|
|:--|--:|
| Wretched      |	-	|
| Squalid       |	1 cr	|
| Poor          |	2 cr	|
| Modest        |	10 cr	|
| Comfortable   |	20 cr	|
| Wealthy       |	at least 100 cr	|
| Aristocratic  |	at least 1,000 cr 	|

#### Wretched
You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.

### Squalid
You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed diseased.

#### Poor
A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a cantina. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

#### Modest
A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, and the like.

#### Comfortable
Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small domicile in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine establishment. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.

#### Wealthy
Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.

#### Aristocratic
You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of the affluent. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.	

## Food, Drink, and Lodging					
The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night's lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.

#### Food, Drink, and Lodging

> #### Self-Sufficiency
> The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter assume that you are spending your time between adventures in cities, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford- paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to repair your equipment, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.
> 
> Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, as described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

## Services
Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a fighter might commission an armstech to craft a special vibroblade, while a scholar might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming meeting with a senator. 

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a trandoshan army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the facilities clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.

#### Services

| &nbsp; Interplanetary Travel  | 100 cr per day per person   |

## Droids
One common way to spend wealth is to purchase droids. Some droids are built for scouting, while others offer advanced skillsets. Protocol droids help communicate with foreign bodies, and combat droids can help supplement a budding force. The Droids table offers some choices for purchase.

> The following prices are lore examples and might not be balanced for actual play. Consider lowering or raising the price based on the Experience value of a particular droid. 
> 
> - Experience Value x SizeModifier x 10 credits <br>
> 
> Experience is found on each monster stat block next to their CR rating.<br>
> Size Modifier is a numerical representation of a monster's size category:<br>
> ( Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, Large = 4, Huge = 5, Gargantuan = 6 )
> 
> Example: A B1-A Battle Droid has an Experience Value of 25 (CR 1/8) and a Size Modifer or 3 (Medium creature). 25 [XP] x 3 [SizeModifer] x 10 [credits] = 750 credits

|Droid Designation|Cost|
|:--|--:|
| 3PO Series Protocol Droid         |7,000 cr|
| B1-A Battle Droid                 |1,800 cr|
| B2-A Battle Droid                 |3,300 cr|
| Droideka-Series Destroyer Droid   |21,000 cr|
| DUM Series Pit Droid              |1,300 cr|
| DRK-1 Probe Droid                 |300 cr|
| IG-86 Assassin Droid              |7,800 cr|
| HK-50 Assassin Droid              |33,000 cr|
| R2 Series Astromech Droid         |7,500 cr|

## Mounts and Vehicles
Mounts and vehicles are the two most common types of on-planet transport. 

> The following prices are lore or instinctual examples and might not be balanced for actual play. Consider lowering or raising the price based on the Experience value of a particular mount or vehicle. 
> 
> - Experience Value x SizeModifier x 10 credits <br>
> 
> Experience is found on each monster stat block next to their CR rating.<br>
> Size Modifier is a numerical representation of a monster's size category:<br>
> ( Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, Large = 4, Huge = 5, Gargantuan = 6 )
> 
> Example: A Rancor, Adolescent has an Experience Value of 3,900 (CR 8) and a Size Modifer or 4 (Large creature). 3,900 [XP] x 4 [SizeModifer] x 10 [credits] = 156,000 credits

### Mounts
A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's speed and base carrying capacity.

An animal pulling a cart or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.

Mounts other than those listed here are available in the worlds of *Star Wars*, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase, like aiwhas from Kamino. Acquiring such a mount is often an adventure in-and-of itself.

Mounts are governed by Animal Handling proficiency.

#### Barding
Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight of barding varies based on the size of the creature, as shown in the Tack, Harness, and Drawn Vehicles table.

#### Saddles
A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding an exotic mount.

#### Mounts and Other Animals

|**Item**|**Cost**|**Speed**|**Size**|**Carrying Capacity**|
|:--|--:|:--:|:--:|--:|
|	Tauntaun            |   500 cr      | Large |	50 ft.	|	480 lb      |
|	Kaadu               |   450 cr      | Large |	40 ft.	|   420 lb      |
|	Rancor, Adolescent  |   156,000 cr  | Large |	40 ft.	|   600 lb      |

|	Stabling (per day)  |	  5 cr	|	—	    |				
|	Wagon               |	350 cr	|	400.00 lb	|	

### Vehicles
Vehicles are more common on civilized planets than animal mounts. Vehicles do not have access to barding and do not require saddles. Vehicles vary greatly based on price, speed, carrying capacity, personnel capacity, and armaments (if any). Below are some base costs for standard types of speeders. Vehicles are governed by Piloting proficiency.
								
|	Item	    	|	Cost	    |	Speed	|
|	:--	        	|	--:	        |	--:	    |
|	74-Z Speeder Bike   |	6,750 cr	|	310 mph	|
|   X-34 Landspeeder    |  10,550 cr    |   155 mph |
|   XJ-6 Airspeeder     |  55,000 cr    |   450 mph |	

#### Used Vehicles
Sometimes you might come across a used vehicle. These vehicles cost less to purchase at the expess of lower capabilities.

- A used vehicle’s value is reduced by half and it's speed is reduced by 25 percent.
