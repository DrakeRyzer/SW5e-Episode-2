# Tactical Specialist

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/fighter_tactical.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Those fighters who choose to become Tactical Specialists employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Tactical Specialist, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as armstech or armormech. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Tactical Specialty, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.

You can use each maneuver twice per turn, instead of once.

Additionally, choose two maneuvers you know. The chosen maneuvers count as general maneuvers for you. You can choose another maneuver at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these maneuvers with another maneuver you know.

## Know Your Enemy
_**Tactical Specialist:** 7th level_<br>
If you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own.

- Strength score
- Dexterity score
- Constitution score
- Armor Class
- Current hit points
- Total class levels (if any)
- Fighter class levels (if any)
