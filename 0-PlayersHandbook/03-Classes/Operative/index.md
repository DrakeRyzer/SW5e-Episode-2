# Operative

<img src='../../../zzImages/Classes/operative_01.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

A Bothan spy takes a moment to adjust her infrared goggles.</span> Nimbly sidestepping the laser grid in the room, she slips to the computer at the far end. Counting down the seconds in her head, she slices the mainframe. Twenty seconds. Ten seconds. A handful of soldiers bursts into the room, but she is already gone Ã± with the data in hand. 

With a wary eye on the door, a scruffy-looking Duros plays pazaak in a seedy cantina. When two city guards appear at the exit, he smiles and reaches under the table. Before they can move in, the smuggler flips the table and opens fire. The crowd scatters in panic, giving him just enough cover to escape. 

A gorgeous young human dances before an intoxicated senator in his parlor. She winks enticingly through her golden blonde hair as she sways closer. Leaning in for a kiss, the senator is instead surprised by the barrel of a hold-out blaster pistol shoved into his mouth. He has no time to shout before the assassin pulls the trigger. 

Operatives, whether good, bad, or neutral, are those who focus on a specific practice and utilize it to get the upper hand. They can come from any world or region in the galaxy, with origins from the lowliest scoundrel to the once social elite.

## Evading Danger
Operatives have a knack for getting out of trouble. They have an instinct for self-preservation that keeps them alive, but it's usually tempered with a need to experience the thrills that their profession has to offer, and many adventurous operatives are also saddled with a sense of honor that sometimes makes them go against their natural inclinations. No matter what their immediate concerns may be, survival is the name of the game.

## Outside the Law
Operatives don't often start out seeking to defy authority and break the law. Some are thrust into the profession as a means of rebellion. Others wind up on the wrong side of the law due to bad luck, poor decisions, or circumstances beyond their control. The skills they pick up along the way make them great members of any mission team.

## Creating an Operative
While creating your operative character, consider how you first started on your path. Maybe you were raised on the street and fell into the criminal element as a means of survival. You could be a simple trader who decided to strike against the Sith Empire when it encroached on your business. What would you say is your greatest skill set? What is your core, the truest essence about yourself that keeps you focused? Why would society treat you as a criminal, yet your allies hold you as a loyal companion?

### Quick Build
You can make an operative quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence or Charisma. Second, choose the gambler background.

|	&emsp;&emsp;Class		|	Funds&emsp;&emsp;	|
|	:--			|	--:			|

### Expertise
_**Operative:** 1st and 6th level_<br>
Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.

### Sneak Attack
_**Operative:** 1st level_<br>
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with a weapon attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. This damage is the same as the weapon's damage, and the attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. 

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the operative table.

### Cunning Action
_**Operative:** 2nd level_<br>
Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide actions as a bonus action.

### Operative Exploits
_**Operative:** 2nd level_<br>
You've adopted two exploits, as detailed at the end of the class description. You adopt an additional exploit at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Bad Feeling
_**Operative:** 3rd level_<br>
You have a wary eye, bordering on paranoia. When you roll for initiative, you can move up to your speed. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined. 

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Operative Practice
_**Operative:** 3rd, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You choose a practice that you emulate in the exercise of your operative abilities, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your practice choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
_**Operative:** 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_<br>

When an attacker that you can see deals damage to you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

### Evasion
_**Operative:** 7th level_<br>
When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent
_**Operative:** 11th level_<br>
You have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Ability checks you make that let you add your proficiency bonus gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7.

### Blindsense
_**Operative:** 14th level_<br>
If you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### Slippery Mind
_**Operative:** 15th level_<br>
You have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. 

### Elusive
_**Operative:** 18th level_<br>
You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck
_**Operative:** 20th level_<br>
You have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. Your Dexterity and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, if your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

You can select this exploit multiple times, each time choosing a new skill and a tool, or two new tools.

### Mentor's Exploit
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_<br>
Once per turn, whenever both you and a friendly creature within 60 feet that can see and hear you both have to make a saving throw to resist the same effect, you can choose to have disadvantage on the save. If you do so, the friendly creature gains advantage on the save. You can use this feature before or after you both make the saving throw, but you must do so before the GM says whether the save succeeds or fails.

### Skill's Exploit
You learn an exploit that enhances your ability to apply your knowledge to combat situations. You can take this exploit multiple times.

When you take the Attack action, you can use one of your skill exploits granted by this feature. You can use these features a combined two times. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Choose from the following. You must be proficient in the skill in order to take that skill's exploit.

***Angle (Perception).*** You attempt to predict the behavior of a humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.

If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

***Battle Cry (Intimidation).*** You attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is frightened until the end of your next turn. If the target was already frightened of you, it must immediately drop whatever it is holding.

If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

***Charm (Persuasion).*** You attempt to convince one humanoid you can see within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If you have dealt damage to the creature in the last hour, it has advantage on the check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you until the start of your next turn, and it has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against a creature before the end of its next turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

***Confuse Beast (Animal Handling).*** You attempt to confuse one beast on the battlefield. Make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check.

If your check fails, the target can't be deceived by you in this way for 1 hour.

***Hacktivate (Technology).*** You attempt to determine the weaknesses in a droid you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check.

If you do so, and they hit, they deal additional damage equal to your bonus to Investigation checks. This damage is the same type as the attack's damage. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

***Intuit (Insight).*** You attempt to determine the motivations of one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check.

If your check succeeds, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead has advantage on attack rolls against you, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn.

***Study (Lore).*** You attempt to anticipate your target's action. Make an Intelligence (Lore) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn. Alternatively, before the end of your next turn, you can use your reaction to grant disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw the target makes against you. If your check fails, you instead have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.

***Tumble (Acrobatics).*** You attempt to make a quick tumble, immediately moving 10 feet. If you begin or end this movement within a creature's reach, make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by it's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from it, and you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against it before the end of your turn. If your check fails, you immediately fall prone.

***Wrestle (Athletics).*** You attempt to grab and pin a creature within 5 feet of you with at least one free hand. The target must be no more than one size larger than you.

## Operative Practices
Operatives share, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes, though their practices differ. Your practice grants you features at 3rd, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
