# Chapter 3: Classes

Adventurers are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can't stand against. 
Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It's more than a profession; it's your character's calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the galaxy. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A consular, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant of the Force. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the consular might know a number of Jedi or Sith who share his faith.

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter's mastery of weapons and armor, and an engineer's powers. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, as well as a detailed explanation of each one.

At 3rd level, each class gains an archetype, or subclass, that helps that class focus in a specific direction or enable an entirely new playstyle, such as allowing raging in heavy armor for Juggernaut Approach berserkers or granting techcasting to Shield Specialist fighters. Each archetype grants additional features at higher levels, varying by class, as shown in the class table.

Additionally, each class has a second level of customization, such as a consular's Force-Empowered Casting or a scholar's Discoveries. The level at which each class obtains this second level varies. If a class's customization requires a level, that refers to class level. If a customization has prerequisites, the character must meet them to learn it. A character can learn a customization at the same time it meets the customization's prerequisites. Unless otherwise specified, a customization can only be taken once.

> #### Multiclassing
> Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. An operative might switch direction in life and become an engineer, or a berserker might discover latent Force-sensitivity and dabble in the guardian class while continuing to advance as a berserker. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, appear in chapter 6.
