# Chapter 3: Classes

Adventurers are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can't stand against. 
Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It's more than a profession; it's your character's calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the galaxy. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A consular, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant of the Force. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the consular might know a number of Jedi or Sith who share his faith.

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter's mastery of weapons and armor, and an engineer's powers. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, as well as a detailed explanation of each one.

At 3rd level, each class gains an archetype, or subclass, that helps that class focus in a specific direction or enable an entirely new playstyle, such as allowing raging in heavy armor for Juggernaut Approach berserkers or granting techcasting to Shield Specialist fighters. Each archetype grants additional features at higher levels, varying by class, as shown in the class table.

Additionally, each class has a second level of customization, such as a consular's Force-Empowered Casting or a scholar's Discoveries. The level at which each class obtains this second level varies. If a class's customization requires a level, that refers to class level. If a customization has prerequisites, the character must meet them to learn it. A character can learn a customization at the same time it meets the customization's prerequisites. Unless otherwise specified, a customization can only be taken once.

> #### Multiclassing
> Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. An operative might switch direction in life and become an engineer, or a berserker might discover latent Force-sensitivity and dabble in the guardian class while continuing to advance as a berserker. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, appear in chapter 6.

Choose from the following class options:

## Berserker
A massive wookiee hunter prowls through the forest, hefting his vibroaxe. With a roar he charges at the pair of trandoshans who dared poach his kin. 

A gamorrean snarls at the latest challenger to his authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with his bare hands as he did to the last six rivals. 

Frothing at the mouth, a nikto slams his helmet into the face of his foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.

These berserkers, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For every berserker, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.

### Primal Instinct
People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a berserker, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Berserkers are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive where the civilized don't.

Berserkers come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A berserker can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.

### A Life of Danger
Not every person deemed "berserkers" by scions of civilized society has the berserker class. A true berserker among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Berserkers charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.

Their courage in the face of danger makes berserkers perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a berserker. Some berserkers miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.

### Creating a Berserker
When creating a berserker character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your GM about an appropriate origin for your berserker. Did you come from a remote planet, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where berserkers are common?

What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled planets by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to "civilized" lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.

#### Quick Build
You can make a berserker quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the mercenary background.

### Rage
_**Berserker:** 1st level_<br>
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action if you aren't wearing heavy armor.

While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a berserker, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the berserker table.
- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.

If you are able to cast powers, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious, you don heavy armor, or if your turn ends and you haven't taken a hostile action or taken damage since your last turn. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

You can enter a rage a number of times as shown in the Rages column of the berserker table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Unarmored Defense
_**Berserker:** 1st level_<br>
While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Reckless Attack 
_**Berserker:** 2nd level_<br>
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Berserker Instincts
_**Berserker:** 2nd level_<br>
You've honed two instincts, as detailed at the end of the class description, and you hone more at higher levels, as shown in the Berserker Instincts column of the berserker table.

### Danger Sense
_**Berserker:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and powers. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

### Berserker Approach
_**Berserker:** 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level_<br>
You choose an approach that shapes the nature of your rage which is detailed at the end of the class description. 

### Ability Score Improvement
_**Berserker:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_<br>
You can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
_**Berserker:** 5th level_<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Feral Impulse
_**Berserker:** 7th level_<br>
Your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative checks.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the start of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### Brutal Critical
_**Berserker:** 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. 

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

### Relentless Rage
_**Berserker:** 11th level_<br>
Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Persistent Rage
_**Berserker:** 15th level_<br>
Your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

### Indomitable Might
_**Berserker:** 18th level_<br>
If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion
_**Berserker:** 20th level_<br>
You embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.

Additionally, you can enter rage an unlimited number of times, and entering rage no longer requires your bonus action on your turn.

#### Hawk's Instinct
_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_<br>

#### Rancor's Instinct
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_<br>
While you're raging any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.

#### Tactician's Instinct
When you use your Reckless Attack feature, you can choose to not have advantage on your attack rolls this turn. If you do so, friendly creatures within 5 feet of a hostile creature that is within 5 feet of you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature.

#### Tracker's Instinct
_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_<br>
You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.

#### Terentatek's Instinct

#### Varactyl's Instinct
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_<br>
While raging, you have advantage on Dexterity checks, your attack rolls can't suffer from disadvantage, and each slowed level only reduces your speed by 5 feet, unless it would reduce your speed to 0.

## Berserker Approaches
For berserkers, rage is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Your approach grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

<!--- image here <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/gb8mhq2.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:0px;right:70px;width:325px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' /> --->

## Ballistic Approach
For many, rushing an opponent with guns blazing is a last resort. For Berserkers of the Ballistic Approach, this isn't a last resort; it's the primary plan. Leading with a blaster and pure, unbridled rage, the berserker never lets an empty gun diminish their fury.

### Firestorm
_**Ballistic Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in martial blasters with the burst or rapid property. Additionally, you've learned to use ranged weapons with untold fury. While wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

- You can use your choice of Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls of blaster weapons against targets within 30 feet of you. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- When you use a blaster as an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient with it.

### Explosive
_**Ballistic Approach:** 3rd and 9th level_<br>
While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- Your blaster weapon damage rolls gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7.
- You add your rage damage to damage rolls from ranged weapon attacks using Strength. 
- At 9th level, when a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw against your burst or rapid property, you can add your Brutal Critical dice to the damage.

### Rampage
_**Ballistic Approach:** 6th level_<br>
While raging, when you deal damage with a blaster with which you are proficient, and you added your Strength modifier to the damage roll, you can use a bonus action to move up to half your speed towards your target. You must end this movement closer to your target than you started. If you end this movement within 5 feet of your target, you can make one melee weapon attack with your blaster as a part of this bonus action.

### Down, Not Out
_**Ballistic Approach:** 10th level_<br>
When you are hit with an attack by a creature within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a single attack against that creature with a blaster with which you are proficient.

### Brawn
_**Ballistic Approach:** 14th level_<br>
When you use the burst property of a blaster with which are you proficient, you can apply your rage damage bonus to every target that takes damage, instead of just one. Additionally, when a Large or smaller creature fails the saving throw against your burst or rapid property while within 30 feet of you, it is knocked prone.

<!--- image here <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/ahaCpxp.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-12px;left:-48px;width:535px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' /> --->

## Cyclone Approach
The Cyclone Approach empowers the berserker's ability to fight with weapons in each hand. Followers of this approach learn to move quickly to avoid attacks and can become a whirlwind of fury and steel, cleaving through hordes of enemies.

### Dual Wielder
_**Cyclone Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
When you engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can add your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) to the damage of your Two-Weapon Fighting attack as long as it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Double Swing
_**Cyclone Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
Once on each of your turns when you miss with an attack while raging, you can immediately make a melee weapon attack with a weapon wielded in a different hand. 

### Twisting Winds
_**Cyclone Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Your unpredictable movement makes you harder to hit and pin down. When you make a saving throw or ability checks to avoid being knocked prone, pushed, grappled, or restrained, you can add your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

### Mighty Leap
_**Cyclone Approach:** 10th level_<br>
The distance you can jump is doubled, and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity if you leave a hostile creature's reach while jumping.

### Tornado
_**Cyclone Approach:** 14th and 17th level_<br>
Once on each of your turns, you can become a tornado of attacks. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your regular attacks to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. If you are wielding a separate melee weapon in each hand, each successful hit against a target deals damage equal to the damage dice of both weapons + your ability modifier + any other modifiers.

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

<!--- image here <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/N7AJIeU.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-116px;right:0px;width:825px;z-index:1000;' /> --->

## Juggernaut Approach
Certain berserkers find that the strongest offense is a good defense. Berserkers of the Juggernaut Approach wear the heaviest of armor not because they fear injury, but to strike fear in their hapless attackers.

### Armored Brute
_**Juggernaut Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You've learned to fight in the heaviest of armors, using your weight to your advantage. You gain proficiency in heavy armor, you can enter a rage while wearing heavy armor, and you can gain the benefits of your Rage feature while wearing heavy armor. 

### Unstoppable Force
_**Juggernaut Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
Your momentum makes you nigh unstoppable. While raging, you can move through a hostile creature's space regardless of that creature's size. When you do so, you must make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check. If you move at least 10 feet before moving through a hostile creature's space, and that creature is your size or smaller, they have disadvantage on the check. If you succeed, you don't treat the movement as difficult terrain, the creature is pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice, and you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature until the end of your turn.

### Raging Bulwark
_**Juggernaut Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Your imposing form acts as a shield for your allies. When a friendly creature you can see is the target of a ranged attack, or forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, and you can see the source of the effect, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the friendly creature. You must end this move closer to the ally than you started. If you end this movement between your ally and the source of the effect, you provide cover for the attack.

Additionally, you provide three-quarters cover, instead of half-cover, to creatures of the same size category, and you provide full cover, instead of three-quarters cover, to creatures one size smaller than you.

### Overwhelming Cleave
_**Juggernaut Approach:** 10th level_<br>
When you successfully push a creature into a surface or another creature while raging, the pushed creature takes kinetic damage equal to your Rage Damage. Additionally, the first time you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength each turn, you can attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

### Relentless Assault
_**Juggernaut Approach:** 14th level_<br>
You're able to charge in unerring bursts. As an action, you can charge up to twice your speed in a straight line without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of your path must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, the target chooses the ability they use use). On a failed save, a creature takes damage equal to your Strength modifier + your Rage damage and, if it is no more than one size category larger than you, is pushed back 5 feet in a direction of your choice. Creatures smaller than you make this save with disadvantage. When you end this movement, if a creature is within 5 feet of you, you can make one melee weapon attack (no action required). On a hit, the creature takes additional damage equal to your berserker level.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Marauder Approach
Few things are more terrifying than being in the path of a Berserker who has learned the ways of the Force. Those who follow this path unlock something deep within them, a well of untamed power from the depths of their fury. When a marauder unleashes their rage, they channel their brute strength into primal might, and uses it to devastate his foes in a hail of fire, blades, and blood. Due to the uncontrolled nature of their powers, marauders have a dangerous predilection for the strength and raw power offered by the dark side, and many fall into it's clutches. Even those who do not are always temped by the voices of fury barely contained within.

### Forcecasting
_**Marauder Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You have derived powers from your primal connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your berserker level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Marauder Approach Forcecasting table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

___

**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

___

### Furious Force
_**Marauder Approach:** 3rd level_<br>
You can cast force powers while raging as long as the power's casting time is no more than 1 action, the power does not require concentration, and you are not wearing heavy armor. While raging, you add your rage damage to damage rolls from force powers you cast that require a force attack or saving throw. If a force power damages more than one target, you may only apply your rage damage to one of them. 

Casting force powers during rage counts as attacking for the purposes of maintaining rage, and you can use your Reckless Attack feature to gain advantage when casting a force power that requires a force attack.

### Reckless Power
_**Marauder Approach:** 6th level_<br>
Weapons and the force are equally an extension of your rage. While you are raging and you use your action to cast a force power, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action.



### Powerful Presence
_**Marauder Approach:** 10th level_<br>
As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with force energy. Choose up to ten other creatures of within 60 feet of you that can hear you. Friendly creatures have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn, and hostile creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your next turn.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Force Storm
_**Marauder Approach:** 14th level_<br>
You can expel the might of your rage all at once to unleash a devastating storm of force energy. As an action, you can end your rage early, forcing each creature within 15 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d12 force damage for each round you've spent in rage, or half as much on a successful one.

## Consular
A twi'lek in black robes steps on a terrified rodian, who </span> scampers away on the ground. Lightning sparks from his fingers, illuminating his red and black tattoos. The rodian's pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears as the Sith channels his lightning into his failed apprentice, leaving nothing but a charred husk behind.

Sitting cross-legged on a dense patch of grass, a miraluka mystic meditates on the Force. With every breath, the trees sway with a rhythmic breeze. Though she lacks simple vision, she can see the Force as it moves everything around her. 

A drably-robed human focuses inward, channeling the Force into the ground around him. Slowly, all the debris within arms reach rises into the air around him; with a flick of his wrist, he clears the air, sending his projectiles to pound on the approaching tank.

Consulars are the supreme wielders of the Force, defined and united by the powers they cast. Drawing on the omnipresent Force that permeates the universe, consulars cast powers of rejuvenating healing and destructive lightning, draining life-force and manipulating minds; the most powerful with the Force can even experience brief glimpses of the future. 

### Strong with the Force
Refraining from drawing their lightsabers except as a measure of last resort, consulars spend a great deal of time studying the mysteries of the Force. Their knowledge allows them to channel the Force to greater heights, unlocking unrivaled power, and twisting those powers to greater effect. 

### Sage or Sorcerer
Consulars who follow the light side of the Force, using their powers to better their communities and people, are often called sages, while consulars who fall to the dark side and subjugate or cast aside all in their path are commonly called sorcerers. Alternatively, they may tend toward the middle, refraining from politics and war, spending their time in isolation and study.

<!--- image here <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/LbMaFdP.png' style='position:absolute;top:37px;right:-50px;width:600px;mix-blend-mode:darken;transform:scaleX(-1)' /> --->

### Creating a Consular
While creating your consular, consider your personal philosophy in regards to the Force and its most famous practitioners ñ the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Perhaps you were ostracized from your primitive village out of superstition or jealousy. You may have been brutally trained from a young age in the dark side, fueling your innate thirst for power, or perhaps you were trained as a padawan in one of the Jedi temples. How do you treat strangers, and how do they treat you once they know your abilities? What was your family like, or what did you have instead of a family? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray? 

#### Quick Build
You can make a consular quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Wisdom or Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the Jedi or Sith background.

|	:--			|	--:			|
|   &emsp;Consular  |   5d4 x 100 cr&emsp;  |

### Forcecasting
_**Consular:** 1st level_<br>
In your meditations on the force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 9 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the consular table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your consular level x 4, as shown in the Force Points column of the consular table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the consular table.

You may only cast force powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

___

**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier
___

### Force Recovery
_**Consular:** 1st level_<br>
You have learned to regain some of your energy by briefly meditating. When you finish a short rest, you can regain a number of force points equal to half your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.



### Force-Empowered Casting
_**Consular:** 2nd level_<br>
You gain the ability to twist your powers to suit your needs. When you cast a force power, you can expend additional force points to modify the power. You gain two Force-Empowered Casting options, located at the end of the class description, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force-Empowered Casting Options of the cnosular table.

You can use only one Force-Empowered Casting option on a power when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

### Force Shield
_**Consular:** 2nd level_<br>
You learn how to defend yourself purely through your strength with the Force. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to shroud yourself in Force energy. Until the start of your next turn, you have a bonus to AC equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1). This includes the triggering attack.

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Force Affinity
_**Consular:** 3rd level_<br>
You've developed an affinity for one of the three aspects of the Force: the Ashla, the Bendu, or the Bogan. Choose one from the following:

#### Ashla
When you successfully cast a light side power, either your or the target's (your choice) hit point maximum and current hit points increase by an amount equal to the power's level. This effect lasts for 1 minute. You can only have one instance of this effect active at a time.

#### Bendu
You can add both your Wisdom and Charisma modifier to your maximum number of force points, instead of just one.

#### Bogan
Your dark side power damage rolls gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7.

### Consular Tradition
_**Consular:** 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level_<br>
You choose a consular tradition, which is detailed at the end of the class description. 

### Ability Score Improvement
_**Consular:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_<br>
You can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### One with the Force
_**Consular:** 20th level_<br>
Your attunement to the Force is absolute. Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score increases by 4. Additionally, you gain mastery over a single force power, and can cast it with little effort. Choose one 3rd-level force power that you know as your signature power. You can cast it once at 3rd level without expending force points. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast it at a higher level, you must expend force points as normal.

### Force-Empowered Castings
The castings are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Careful Power
When you cast a power that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the power's full force. To do so, you spend 1 additional force point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the power.

#### Distant Power
When you cast a power that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 additional force point to double the range of the power.

Alternatively, when you cast a power that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 additional force point to make the range of the power 30 feet.

#### Extended Power
When you cast a power that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 additional force point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

#### Heightened Power
When you cast a power that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 additional force points to give one target of the power disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the power.

#### Improved Power
When you roll damage for a power, you can spend 1 additional force point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Improved Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.

#### Lingering Power
When you cast a power that requires concentration to maintain you can choose to spend 3 additional force points. If you do, when you lose concentration on the power, the power will not end until the end of your next turn.

#### Pinpoint Power 
When you cast a power that allows you to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw you can instead spend 1 force point and make a ranged force attack against a single target that would be in the range. On a hit the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw.

#### Quickened Power
When you cast a power that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 additional force points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

#### Refocused Power 
When you are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a power you can use your reaction and spend 2 force points to automatically succeed on the saving throw.

You can use Refocused Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.

#### Seeking Power
If you miss with a force power that calls for an attack roll, you can spend 2 force points to reroll the attack. You must use the new roll.

You can use Seeking Power even if you have already used a different Force-Empowered Casting option during the casting of the power.

#### Twinned Power
When you cast a power that can only have one target and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of additional force points equal to the power's level to choose a second target in range with the same power (1 force point if the power is at-will).

## Consular Traditions
Different consulars select different traditions, called Ways, to follow as they hone their powers. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

## Way of Balance
There is serenity in balance, and no one knows this better than the consular. Those consulars who follow the Way of Balance focus on utilizing the Force to equalize the battlefield. They bend the Force to shield their allies and expose their foes.

### Force Barrier
_**Way of Balance:** 3rd level_<br>
You can weave the Force around yourself for protection. When you cast a universal power of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously manipulate the Force to create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The barrier has hit points equal to twice your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). Your barrier can never have hit points greater than twice your consular level + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).

Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the barrier has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its power remains. Whenever you cast a universal power of 1st level or higher, the barrier regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the power.

Once you create the barrier, you can't create it again until you finish a long rest.

### Projected Barrier
_**Way of Balance:** 6th level_<br>
When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Force Barrier to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

### At-Will Barrier
_**Way of Balance:** 10th level_<br>
Your at-will universal powers grant a small boost to your Force Barrier. When you cast an at-will universal power, the barrier regains 1 hit point. You can't restore your barrier above half its maximum hit points in this way.

### Improved Suppression
_**Way of Balance:** 14th level_<br>
When you cast a force power that requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that power, such as *sever force* or *force suppression*, you add your proficiency bonus to that ability check.

### Force Resistance
_**Way of Balance:** 18th level_<br>
You have advantage on saving throws against force powers. Additionally, you have resistance against the damage of force powers.

## Way of Lightning
Of all of the dark arts of the Force, little can match the spectacle and devastation of Force lightning. Those consulars who follow the Way of Lightning summon intense discharges of pure Force energy, overwhelming enemies with punishing damage from a distance, leaving them shaken and vulnerable -- if not dead.

### Shocking Affinity
_**Way of Lightning:** 3rd level_<br>
When you cast a force power that deals lightning damage, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it.

Additionally, when you cast a damage-dealing force power that requires a force attack or saving throw, you can cause that power to instead deal lightning damage. If the power would call for a saving throw other than Dexterity, it instead calls for a Dexterity saving throw. If 


you hit with the power, or the target fails the power's saving throw, affected creatures become *shocked* until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Potent Lightning
_**Way of Lightning:** 6th level_<br>
You add your governing ability modifier (minimum of +1) to any damage you deal with force powers that deal lightning damage that don't already include that modifier.

### Blistering Rebuke
_**Way of Lightning:** 10th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 plus your consular level lightning damage, is pushed back 10 feet, and becomes *shocked* until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't moved or *shocked*.

You can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Electric Attunement
_**Way of Lightning:** 14th level_<br>
You gain resistance to lightning damage, and force powers you cast ignore resistance to lightning damage.

### Unlimited Power
_**Way of Lightning:** 18th level_<br>
You can increase the power of your simpler lightning force powers. When you cast a force power of 1st through 6th level that deals lightning damage, you can deal maximum damage with that power.

You can use this feature with no adverse effects a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the consular table. If you use this feature beyond this before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 true damage for each level of the power, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the damage increases by 1d12. 

<!--- image here <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/6tuXtEr.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-13px;left:-33px;width:565px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' /> --->


## Way of the Sage
The rejuvenating power of the Force is incredible, and the consular is the master of this usage. Those consulars who follow the Way of the Sage assist with an array of healing powers that grant allies the strength to continue through even the harshest of encounters. Separated from the heart of the fray, the sage can be an unfailing warden to those in need.

### Disciple of Life
_**Way of the Sage:** 3rd level_<br>
When you cast a force power that restores hit points, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it. 

Additionally, whenever you use a force power of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains extra hit points equal to 2 + the power's level.

### Preserve Life
_**Way of the Sage:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
As an action, you can channel the Force and evoke healing energy that restores a number of hit points equal to five times your consular level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its hit point maximum. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Blessed Healer
_**Way of the Sage:** 10th level_<br>
The healing powers you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a force power that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the power's level.





### Blessed by the Force
_**Way of the Sage:** 14th level_<br>
You gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Supreme Healing
_**Way of the Sage:** 18th level_<br>
When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a power, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For instance, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.

<!--- image here <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/Aceclyv.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:0px;right:-110px;width:700px;z-index:1000;' /> --->



## Way of Suggestion
There is power in a light touch, and no one knows this better than the consular. Those consulars who follow the Way of Suggestion have honed their attunement to the Force, allowing them to disappear, despite being in plain sight.

### Subtle Control
_**Way of Suggestion:** 3rd level_<br>
You can befuddle a creature's mind with nothing but a gesture. As an action, you can cause a creature you can see within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, you can force the creature to believe or forget a single aspect of a conversation, observation or encounter it had that you were present for in the past 10 minutes. Whether the creature succeeds or fails their saving throw, you can't use this feature on them again until you finish a long rest. 

Additionally, creatures who attempt to detect your use of the Force have disadvantage on ability checks to do so, and if a creature has the *sense force* or *force sight* power active, they must succeed on a universal forcecasting ability check against your universal force save DC in order to notice your usage of the Force, your alignment within the Force, or how strong your connection to the Force is. 

### Out of Mind
_**Way of Suggestion:** 6th level_<br>
You can erase yourself from a single creature's sight momentarily. As a bonus action, choose a creature within 60 feet of you that you are aware of. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, you become invisible to that creature for 1 minute, or until you deal damage to it.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Delicate Potency
_**Way of Suggestion:** 10th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
Your mind-affecting powers are particularly potent. When you cast one of *cloud mind*, *dominate mind*, *mass coerce mind*, and *dominate monster*, you can choose to treat the power as if cast at your Max Power Level.

You can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Delayed Effect
_**Way of Suggestion:** 14th level_<br>
When you cast a force power, you can delay the effects of the force power for up to a number of rounds equal to half your consular level. If you do so, the power immediately takes effect at the start of your turn, after the specified number of rounds have passed.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.

### Subtle Presence
_**Way of Suggestion:** 18th level_<br>
You've learned how to weave the Force around you in a cloak of your choice. As an action, you can focus the Force for 10 minutes. For the duration, you gain your choice of one of the following effects. 

You can use each feature once. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Cloak of Fright
Each creature of your choice that is within 60 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

#### Cloak of Invisibility
You and everything you are wearing or carrying become invisible to creatures of your choice. If you damage a creature or affect it with a force power, it can make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a success, you are no longer invisible to that creature.

#### Cloak of Memory
Creatures that see you or any allies within 30 feet of you during this time cannot recall your physical appearances, your mannerisms, or any other identifying features.

Creatures that interact with you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your universal force save DC once the interaction ends. You can choose to exclude a creature from this effect. On a failed save, the creature forgets all details of the interaction, rationalizing any of its outcomes.

## Engineer
Flinching occasionally as a blaster bolt hits the nearby</span> bulkhead, a Sullustan mechanic quickly solders a large wire. He peers through his tinted goggles, ignoring the shouts of his ship captain as the enemy descends on the hanger. Finally he shouts with pride as the repaired coupling powers up, causing the frigate to hum with energy. He gathers his tools and runs into the ship moments before it finally takes off. 

Inside, the human captain jumps into the cockpit. She nods to her droid co-pilot, who quickly begins charting a course home. Before the calculations can be completed, enemy Starfighters scream in from the clouds. The pilot rolls the ship, nimbly evading incoming fire. She reroutes the power to shields, leaving just enough for astronavigation. Just as the energy reserves near depletion, the exosphere and stars beyond blur into streaks of light. In a flash, they warp to safety. 

A Cerean officer surveys the battlefield, looking for weaknesses. When he identifies a potential problem, he keys in a quick combination in his wristpad. In a blink, a custom suit of armor assembles itself around him. As the helmet locks into place, the officer leaps into the air, flying overhead and raining destruction on the opposition.

Every machine needs an engineer to run it, and a living crew is no different. Engineers are the experts and professionals who rely on skill, bravery, and their tools to survive and keep others alive. While they do not claim to be fighters, their mere presence can turn the tide of battle or simply keep operations running.


### Behind the Curtain
While perhaps not as intimidating as a heavily-armored trooper, or as exotic as a lighsaber-wielding guardian, engineers are no less vital to group dynamic. They are armorers and gunsmiths, electricians and welders, or any other facet to be found in facilities across the galaxy. Their work, often unsung, is what keeps starships (and their crew) intact.

### Unflappable
It takes bravery for a soldier to enter a battlefield. It perhaps takes more for someone who is unarmed, and untrained in combat, to do the same. Engineers put their lives on the line for a living, whether by choice or acknowledging their plights as an occupational hazard. Whether they come from an elite training academy or learned their talents surviving in the slums, they are no strangers to danger and conflict.

### Creating an Engineer
While creating your engineer character, consider what your primary skill set is and how you use it. You could be a street-smart mechanic who taught yourself how to fix swoop bikes as a teenager. Perhaps you are the recent graduate of an esteemed medical college, or a rookie pilot in the fledgling Rebel Alliance. What is the number one skill you are known for? Why are you willing to enter battles when you have no combat training? How do you view the more adventurous members of your group, and how do they see you and your role?

#### Quick Build
You can make an engineer quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Constitution. Second, choose the scientist background.

You learn 6 tech powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Tech Powers Known column of the engineer table. You may not learn a tech power of a level higher than your Max Power Level.

#### Tech Points
You have a number of tech points equal to your engineer level x 2, as shown in the Tech Points column of the engineer table, + your Intelligence modifier. You use these tech points to cast tech powers. You regain all expended tech points when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many tech powers can be overcharged, consuming more tech points to create a greater effect. You can overcharge these powers to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the engineer table.

You may only cast tech powers at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

#### Techcasting Ability
Intelligence is your techcasting ability for your tech powers. You use your Intelligence whenever a power refers to your techcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a tech power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

**Tech save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

___

**Tech attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier


___

#### Techcasting Focus
You use a wristpad (found in chapter 5) or the tools in which you are granted proficiency by this class as a tech focus for your tech powers.

### Potent Aptitude
_**Engineer:** 1st level_<br>
Your technological experience lends you an uncommon insight that you can use to bolster your allies. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Potent Aptitude die, a d4. This die changes as you gain engineer levels, as shown in the Potent Aptitude column of the engineer table.



Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost.

A creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time.

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Infuse Item
_**Engineer:** 2nd level_<br>
You gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one unenhanced object that is a suit of armor, a shield, or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes an enhanced item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a shield or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. 

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

You learn to modify one unenhanced suit of armor or shield utilizing your armormech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify one suit of armor or a shield. You must have the armor or shield and armormech's implements in order to perform this modification.



Your modified armor or shield is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified armor has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

At 9th level, you can maintain both a modified suit of armor and shield. Each modified item has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table.

### Damage Absorption
_**Armormech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to absorb some of that damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.

### Extra Attack
_**Armormech Engineering:** 6th level_<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.

#### Sealed Suit
_**Prerequisite:** 5th level, Armor_<br>
As a bonus action you can hermetically seal your modified armor, giving you an air supply for up to 1 hour and making you immune to poison (but not curing you of existing poisoned conditions). Your armor regains 1 minute of air for every minute that you are not submerged and the armor is not sealed.

Additionally, while you are wearing your modified armor you are considered adapted to cold and hot climates as well as high altitude, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. 

#### Sentient Armor
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level, Artificially Intelligent_<br>
Your artificial intelligence has learned to control the suit without you being in it. It is now a valid target of the _tracker droid interface_ tech power.

While your armor is acting independently, it uses your ability scores, saving throws, and skills, and it has hit points equal to your engineer level. If reduced to 0 hit points, it falls directly to the ground, and it can not be equipped again until you finish a long rest.

#### Shield Amplifier
_**Prerequisite:** Shield Generator_<br>
You modify your shield generator to project outward. As a bonus action you can amplify your shield until the start of your next turn. Each creature within 5 feet of you gains a bonus to AC equal to your shield's bonus.

### Modified Weaponry
_**Armstech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to modify one unenhanced weapon with which you are proficient utilizing your armstech experience. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify the weapon. You must have the weapon and armstech's implements in order to perform this modification.

Your modified weapon is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified weapon has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

At 9th level, you can maintain two modified weapons. Each modified weapon has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table.

### Close Call
_**Armstech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
When you make an attack roll with your modified weapon and miss, you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to attempt to turn that miss into a hit. Roll the die and add it to the attack roll.

As a bonus action while wearing your gadgeteer harness, you can expend a use of your Potent Aptitude to project a barrier on a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet. A creature can only have one barrier active at a time.

#### Environmental Barrier
You project an environmental barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + your engineer level. Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, or sonic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage. 

#### Physical Barrier
You project a physical barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + half your engineer level. Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of energy, ion, or kinetic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage. 

### Versatile Direction

You can take a second bonus action on each of your turns. You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Reinforced Barriers
_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 14th level_<br>
When you cast a tech power while you have a barrier active, you can restore hit points to the barrier, provided it is within 30 feet of you. You restore a number of hit points equal to twice the power's level, or 1 hit point for an at-will power. This can't increase a barrier's hit points above its initial hit points. If you have multiple barriers active, you can divide these hit points between them as you see fit.

### Adaptive Barrier
_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
When a creature who has one of your barriers within 30 feet of you that you can see takes damage, and that damage is of a type that could be affected by that barrier, you can use your reaction to grant them resistance to the triggering damage. If that damage is the same type as the barrier's chosen damage, you instead grant them immunity. Whether resistance or immunity, the barrier immediately drops to 0 hit points.

## Fighter
A Trandoshan runs frantically across rooftops, constantly</span> looking over his shoulder. As he prepares to leap a gap, a blaster bolt hits him in the back and renders him unconscious. His blurry vision barely makes out the figure of a masked woman who casually approaches, ready to collect her bounty.

With his muscular arms held wide, a grizzled-looking Wookiee grins to his bloodthirsty crowd. He turns back to his arena opponent just in time to see the Besalisk take a swing. He ducks, punching the four-armed fighter in the gut. Two wild haymakers later, and he stands alone as the gladiatorial champion. 

Taking a deep breath, a Republic soldier looks out onto the war zone waging across the frozen surface of Ilum. He grips his blaster rifle tightly then, with a nod to the dozen squad-mates beside him, he charges onto the battlefield. 

Fighters combine discipline with martial skills to become the best pure warriors in the galaxy. Fighters can be stalwart defenders of those in need, cruel marauders, or brave advent-urers. They fight for glory, honor, to right wrongs, to gain power, to acquire wealth, or simple for the thrill of battle.

### All in a Day's Work
Many fighters see adventures, raids on enemy strongholds, and dangerous missions as their jobs. Some want to defend those who can't defend themselves while others seek to use their muscle to carve their own place of importance in the galaxy. Fighters can take the form of guards, champions, bounty hunters, enforcers, mercenaries, freedom fighters, or simply armed explorers.

### Code Red
Most fighters come to the profession after receiving at least some amount of formal training from a military organization. Some attend formal academies; others are self-taught and well tested. A fighter may have taken up his weapon to escape a mundane life while another may be following a proud family tradition. Whatever their origins, most fighters share an unshakeable loyalty. Fighters follow orders with little hesitation, as failure can often mean death.

### Creating a Fighter
While creating your fighter character, consider where your loyalties lie. You could be part of a formal military, one of countless troopers fighting for your enterprise. Perhaps you are a gun-for-hire, traveling the galaxy in search of your next gig. What weapons do you prefer and specialize in? Who or what do you fight for? Do you have aspirations of a life beyond the battlefield, or have you been at war so long you know of nothing else?

#### Quick Build
You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution. Second, choose the soldier background.

## Guardian
A dark-skinned human quickly runs down a corridor, the</span> metal armor under his grey cloak clanking with each step. He rounds the corner into the prison while the lights and power are still out, urging the weakened prisoners to escape. Just then a handful of slavers arrive and ready their blasters. The man draws and ignites a white-bladed lightsaber, ready to die for the strangers behind him. 

A sith pureblood, clad head to toe in black and red armor, charges towards a line of soldiers. Shot after shot deflects off his armor until he reaches his prey, where he unleashes his fury in a series of devastating lightsaber sweeps. 

A zabrak general dramatically leaps to his soon-to-be overrun squad, landing with a flurry of lightsaber attacks. At the arrival of this powerful Jedi, the attackers fall back.

Guardians are the master of the art of lightsaber combat. They focus on utilizing the everpresent power of the Force to enable devastating attacks, often single-handedly turning the tide of battle.

### Protector or Destroyer
An unstoppable agent of the Force, the guardian channels the power flowing through him into his weapons. Their skills with a lightsaber are unrivalled. Subduing their enemies and bolstering their allies, the guardian uses the Force to control what happens around them.


### Natural Leaders
The guardian's command of the Force lends them a powerful presence. Whether through fear and intimidation or respect and admiration, the guardian is one of the greatest generals on the battlefield. They are a symbol of power to their followers.

### Creating a Guardian
While creating your guardian, consider your attraction to the Force and its most famous practitioners ñ the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Are you a soldier tapping into a latent Force-sensitivity? Were you trained in the force from a young age, or did you discover it as an adult? How do you treat those weaker than you? What was your family like? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?

#### Quick Build
You can make a guardian quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Jedi or Sith background.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 5 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the guardian table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your guardian level x 2, as shown in the Force Points column of the guardian table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the guardian table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th and 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

## Monk
Her vibrostaff a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of</span> blaster bolts, a human springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of pirates on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.

Taking a deep breath, a zabrak covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging mercenaries reach him, he exhales and a blast of negative energy courses from his hands, engulfing his foes.

Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad mirialan steps into a shadow beneath an arch and nimbly climbs to the balcony a stone's throw above her. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the warlord, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.

Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

### The Power of Focus
Monks make careful study of a mystical energy that most monastic orders call focus. This energy is an element of the power that suffuses the galaxy-specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this energy within themselves to create powerful effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of focus in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of focus gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

### Training and Asceticism
Most monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other power.

The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or brigands.

For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. 

<!--- image here <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/gFdtzpD.png' style='position:absolute;top:69px;right:-70px;width:570px;'/> --->

### Creating a Monk
As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?

Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?

As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness focus, monks are typically lawful in alignment.

#### Quick Build
You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the agent background.

### Martial Arts
_**Monk:** 1st level_<br> 
Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are vibroweapons with which you are proficient that lack the dexterity, heavy, special, and two-handed properties.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:
- Your unarmed strikes and monk weapons gain the finesse property.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the monk table.
- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength whenever you would make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple, shove, or trip a creature.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. 
- You can take the Dash or Disengage actions as a bonus action.

> ##### Variant: Monks with Lightweapons
> If monks gain lightweapon proficiency, consider letting them use lightweapons as monk weapons, provided the weapon lacks the dexterity, heavy, special, and two-handed properties.

### Unarmored Defense
_**Monk:** 1st level_<br>
While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice).

### Focus
_**Monk:** 2nd and 11th level_<br>
Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of focus. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of focus points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various focus features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a focus point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended focus back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your focus points.

You use your choice of Wisdom or Charisma for your focus ability. You use the chosen ability modifier whenever a feature refers to your focus ability. Additionally, you use the chosen ability modifier when making an attack with a focus feature or setting the saving throw DC for one.


___

**Focus save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)

___

**Focus attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice)

___

#### Flurry of Blows
When you make your Martial Arts bonus action attack, you can spend 1 focus point to make an additional unarmed strike (no action required). At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to make two additional unarmed strikes.

#### Patient Defense
When you use your bonus action to Disengage, you can spend 1 focus point to also Dodge (no action required). At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to Dodge and gain an additional reaction until the start of your next turn. 

#### Step of the Wind
When you use your bonus action to Dash, you can spend 1 focus point to double your jump distance for the turn. At 11th level, you can instead spend 2 focus points to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn, though you fall if you end your speed in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.

### Monastic Vows
_**Monk:** 2nd level_<br>
You've sworn two vows, as detailed at the end of the class description. You swear an additional vow at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Unarmored Movement
_**Monk:** 3rd and 9th level_<br>
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Unarmored Movement column of the monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

### Deflect Missiles
_**Monk:** 3rd level_<br>
You can use your reaction to deflect a projectile when you are dealt damage by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, and the damage is kinetic, energy, or ion, you can redirect it at another target if you have a weapon capable of doing so. You can spend 1 focus point to make a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 as you deflect the projectile, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the projectile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

### Monastic Order
_**Monk:** 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You commit yourself to one monastic order, which is detailed at the end of the class description. 

### Ability Score Improvement
_**Monk:** 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_<br>
You can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Slow Fall
_**Monk:** 4th level_<br>
You can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.

### Extra Attack
_**Monk:** 5th level_<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Stunning Strike
_**Monk:** 5th level_<br>
You can interfere with an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 focus point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

### Enhanced Strikes
_**Monk:** 6th level_<br>
Your unarmed strikes count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.

### Evasion
_**Monk:** 7th level_<br>
Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Stillness of Mind
_**Monk:** 7th level_<br>
You can use your action or bonus action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Purity of Body
_**Monk:** 13th level_<br>
You are immune to disease and poison and resistant to poison damage.

### Diamond Soul
_**Monk:** 14th level_<br>
Your mastery of focus grants you proficiency in all saving throws, and when you fail a saving throw, you can spend 1 focus point to reroll it, taking the new roll.



### Timeless Vessel
_**Monk:** 15th level_<br>
Your focus sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged abnormally. You can still die of old age, however. Additionally, when you complete a short rest, you can expend a Hit Die to remove 1 level of exhaustion or slowed.

### Empty Body
_**Monk:** 18th level_<br>
You can use your action to spend 4 focus points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

### Perfect Self
_**Monk:** 20th level_<br>
You've gained perfect control over your body. Your Dexterity and Wisdom or Charisma scores (your choice) increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, when you roll for initiative and have fewer than 6 focus points remaining, you regain up to 6 focus points.

### Monastic Vows
The vows are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Vow of Deflection
You can use your reaction to divert a strike when you are dealt damage by a melee weapon attack. When you do so, the damage taken by the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

#### Vow of the Devoted
You gain a limited ability to manipulate the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

***Force Powers Known.*** You learn 2 force powers of your choice. You learn an additional power at 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, and 17th level. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite. You may only learn universal powers in this way.

***Force Points.*** Rather than force points, powers you learn through this vow are cast using your focus points, at 1 focus point per power level. You may only cast universal powers in this way.

***Max Power Level.*** Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more focus points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels. Your Max Power Level is 1st. It increases to 2nd at 7th level, 3rd at 13th level, and 4th at 17th level. You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

***Forcecasting Ability.*** You use your focus ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. If a power you cast with focus points calls for a saving throw, you use your focus save DC. If a power you cast with focus points calls for an attack roll, you use your focus attack modifier.


#### Vow of Fate
_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_<br>
When you finish a short or long rest, roll a d20 and record the number rolled. Once before your next short or long rest, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature within 5 feet of you with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll. 

#### Vow of the Fighter
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. 

#### Vow of the Focused
You can substitute Strength, Constitution, or Intelligence (chosen when you take this vow) for Wisdom or Charisma for your monk class features, except for other vows and Monastic Tradition features.

#### Vow of Fortitude
_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_<br>
You can use your action or bonus action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be blinded or deafened. 

#### Vow of Freedom
You ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when you would use your action to break free of an effect that is grappling or restraining you, you can instead use your bonus action.

#### Vow of Intuition
You can no longer have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures within 10 feet of you due to not being able to see them.

#### Vow of the Limber
_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_<br>
When you make your first unarmed strike on your turn, you can choose to spend 1 focus point. If you do so, your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 5 feet until the end of your turn.

#### Vow of the Nemesis
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_<br>
As a bonus action, you can choose one creature within 30 feet that you can see. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your focus save DC. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this feature for 24 hours. On a failed save, for the next minute, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and it must make an additional Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this feature doesn't restrict its movement for that turn. 

This feature ends early if you attack another creature, if you target another hostile creature with a power or class feature, if a friendly creature damages the target, if a friendly creature targets it with a power or class feature, or if you target another creature with this feature.

#### Vow of the Open Mind
You gain proficiency in a skill of your choice. Additionally, you can spend 1 focus point and 10 minutes meditating on a skill in which you are proficient. If you do so, when you make an ability check with the chosen skill, you can add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier to the check. You can only have one instance of this feature active at a time.

#### Vow of Precision
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_<br>
Your critical hit range with unarmed strikes increases by 1.

#### Vow of Requital
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_<br>
When you take the Dodge action and an attack made by a creature within 5 feet of you misses you before the start of your next turn, you can use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack with a monk weapon or unarmed strike against that creature.

#### Vow of Restoration
When you would make an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 focus point to instead touch a willing creature within your reach. Roll your Martial Arts die. The target gains hit points equal to the amount rolled + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).

#### Vow of the Sentry
You gain proficiency in light and medium armor. Additionally, you can now gain the benefits of your Martial Arts and Unarmored Movement features while wearing light or medium armor as long as you are not wielding a shield.

#### Vow of Serenity
Your maximum focus increases by an amount equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1).

#### Vow of Spirit
You can use your choice of Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Vow of the Versatile
When you would make an unarmed strike as part of your Martial Arts bonus action attack or your Flurry of Blows, you can instead make a weapon attack with a monk weapon you are wielding, using your Martial Arts die in place of the weapon's damage.

## Monastic Orders
Orders of monastic pursuit are common in the locales scattered across the galaxy. Each order is based in a specific culture and is mutually exclusive, despite relying on the same basic techniques. Your order grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

## Crimson Order
Monks of the Crimson Order are unyielding in their resolve. They pledge themselves to a singular entity or belief, and uphold their service with solemnity and diligence. 

### Crimson Armaments
_**Crimson Order:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in light and medium armor. If you are already proficient in light and medium armor, you instead gain proficiency in heavy armor. Additionally, you can now gain the benefits of your Martial Arts and Unarmored Movement features while wearing armor as long as you are not wielding a shield.

Additionally, you've learned to adapt to new weaponry. Over the course of an hour, which can be performed during a short rest, you can perform a kata with a weapon of your choice. You gain proficiency in that weapon if you do not already have proficiency, and it becomes a monk weapon for you. You can only adapt to one weapon at a time, and if you attempt to adapt to another weapon you immediately lose your proficiency with the chosen weapon.

### Crimson Squall
_**Crimson Order:** 6th, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You've learned to enhance your kata. As a bonus action while wielding a monk weapon, you can expend 1 focus point to cause the area within 5 feet of you to become difficult terrain for hostile creatures for 1 minute.

### Vigilant Sentinel

When you attempt to perceive your surroundings on your turn, you can opt to not move on that turn.

You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect.


### Sovereign Protector
_**Crimson Order:** 17th level_<br>
Your mastery of focus has allowed you to unlock your fullest potential in combat. As a bonus action, you can gain the following effects for 1 minute.
- Your speed is doubled.
- Your AC increases by 2.
- You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.
- You gain an additional action of each of your turns. This action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Echani Order
Monks of the Echani Order train relentlessly both with and without their weapons, to the point where the weapon becomes an extension of the body. Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons.

### Echani Weapons
_**Echani Order:** 3rd level_<br>
Your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. You gain the following benefits. Choose two types of weapons to be your Echani weapons: one vibroweapon and one blaster. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the special property. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this order's features work only with your Echani weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon to be an Echani weapon for you, following the criteria above.

#### Agile Parry
If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding an Echani weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.

#### Echani's Shot
You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with an Echani weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using an Echani weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.

### One with the Blade
_**Echani Order:** 6th level_<br>
You extend your focus into your Echani weapons, granting you the following benefits.

#### Enhanced Echani Weapons
Your attacks with your Echani weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.

#### Deft Strike
When you hit a target with an Echani weapon, you can spend 1 focus point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

### Sharpen the Blade
_**Echani Order:** 11th level_<br>
You gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your focus. As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 focus points to grant one Echani weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on an enhanced weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.

### Unerring Accuracy
_**Echani Order:** 17th level_<br>
Your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you miss with an attack roll using a monk weapon on your turn, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns. 

## Matukai Order
Monks of the Matukai Order center their philosophy around  a balance and harmony between the spiritual Force and the physical body, using exercise as a form of meditation. They channel the Force through their bodies, turning themselves into exceptional warriors.

### Force-Enhanced Strikes
_**Matukai Order:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to channel the Force into your unarmed strikes and monk weapons, further enhancing your melee strikes. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or melee weapon attack with a monk weapon, you can spend 1 focus point to force the creature to make a Strength saving throw against your focus save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 force damage and is pushed up to 15 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature only takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

### Instinctive Leap
_**Matukai Order:** 6th level_<br>
When a hostile creatures moves to within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to disengage and leap up to half your speed. If you end this movement in the air, you immediately fall to the ground.

### Absorb Damage
_**Matukai Order:** 11th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to channel the Force into your skin and bones, greatly enhancing your durability. You can use a bonus action to channel the Force throughout your body. Until the start of your next turn, you have resistance to kinetic and energy damage.

You can use this feature four times. You gain an additional use at 13th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Control the Field
_**Matukai Order:** 17th level_<br>
Whenever you use your Instinctive Leap feature, you can leap your entire movement speed instead of only half. Additionally, when you land, you can make an unarmed strike with advantage against a creature within 5 feet of you as part of the same reaction. On a hit, this attack deals an additional 2d6 force damage.

<!--- image here <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/y7y9lEX.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-3px;right:-305px;width:1050px;transform:scaleX(-1);z-index:1000' /> --->

## Nightsister Order
Monks of the Nightsister Order utilize an innate Force-sensitivity to commune with death. They learn to channel this power to drain the life of their foes to prolong their own existence. Males who join this order are called Nightbrothers.

### Ichor Lightning
_**Nightsister Order:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged focus attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your focus ability modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is necrotic, it counts as an unarmed strike for the sake of your Martial Arts feature, and it uses your Martial Arts die for its damage die. When you would make an unarmed strike as part of your Martial Arts bonus action attack or your Flurry of Blows, you can replace the attack with this one.

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your focus ability modifier (your choice, minimum of one) + your monk level.

### Dark Magick
_**Nightsister Order:** 6th level_<br>
You can use your action to force each creature within 30 feet of you that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your focus save DC or be charmed or frightened (your choice) of you until the end of your next turn. 

### Mastery of Death
_**Nightsister Order:** 11th level_<br>
When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 focus point (no action required) to have 1 hit point instead.

### Spirit Blade Assault
_**Nightsister Order:** 17th level_<br>
As an action, you conjure a blade of spirit energy and strike one creature within 5 feet of you with it, expending 1 to 10 focus points. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your focus save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 necrotic damage per focus point spent, or half as much on a successful one. 

<!--- image here <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/R0ZTJew.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:25px;left:-0px;width:665px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' /> --->

## Operative
A Bothan spy takes a moment to adjust her infrared goggles.</span> Nimbly sidestepping the laser grid in the room, she slips to the computer at the far end. Counting down the seconds in her head, she slices the mainframe. Twenty seconds. Ten seconds. A handful of soldiers bursts into the room, but she is already gone ñ with the data in hand. 

With a wary eye on the door, a scruffy-looking Duros plays pazaak in a seedy cantina. When two city guards appear at the exit, he smiles and reaches under the table. Before they can move in, the smuggler flips the table and opens fire. The crowd scatters in panic, giving him just enough cover to escape. 

A gorgeous young human dances before an intoxicated senator in his parlor. She winks enticingly through her golden blonde hair as she sways closer. Leaning in for a kiss, the senator is instead surprised by the barrel of a hold-out blaster pistol shoved into his mouth. He has no time to shout before the assassin pulls the trigger. 

Operatives, whether good, bad, or neutral, are those who focus on a specific practice and utilize it to get the upper hand. They can come from any world or region in the galaxy, with origins from the lowliest scoundrel to the once social elite.

### Evading Danger
Operatives have a knack for getting out of trouble. They have an instinct for self-preservation that keeps them alive, but it's usually tempered with a need to experience the thrills that their profession has to offer, and many adventurous operatives are also saddled with a sense of honor that sometimes makes them go against their natural inclinations. No matter what their immediate concerns may be, survival is the name of the game.

### Outside the Law
Operatives don't often start out seeking to defy authority and break the law. Some are thrust into the profession as a means of rebellion. Others wind up on the wrong side of the law due to bad luck, poor decisions, or circumstances beyond their control. The skills they pick up along the way make them great members of any mission team.


<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/62G6gbZ.png' style='position:absolute;top:49px;right:0px;width:460px;mix-blend-mode:darken' /> --->

### Creating an Operative
While creating your operative character, consider how you first started on your path. Maybe you were raised on the street and fell into the criminal element as a means of survival. You could be a simple trader who decided to strike against the Sith Empire when it encroached on your business. What would you say is your greatest skill set? What is your core, the truest essence about yourself that keeps you focused? Why would society treat you as a criminal, yet your allies hold you as a loyal companion?

#### Quick Build
You can make an operative quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence or Charisma. Second, choose the gambler background.

|	&emsp;&emsp;Class		|	Funds&emsp;&emsp;	|
|	:--			|	--:			|
|   &emsp;Operative |	7d4 x 100 cr&emsp;  |



### Expertise
_**Operative:** 1st and 6th level_<br>
Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.

### Sneak Attack
_**Operative:** 1st level_<br>
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with a weapon attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. This damage is the same as the weapon's damage, and the attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. 

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the operative table.

### Cunning Action
_**Operative:** 2nd level_<br>
Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide actions as a bonus action.

### Operative Exploits
_**Operative:** 2nd level_<br>
You've adopted two exploits, as detailed at the end of the class description. You adopt an additional exploit at 7th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Bad Feeling
_**Operative:** 3rd level_<br>
You have a wary eye, bordering on paranoia. When you roll for initiative, you can move up to your speed. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined. 

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Operative Practice
_**Operative:** 3rd, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You choose a practice that you emulate in the exercise of your operative abilities, which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your practice choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
_**Operative:** 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_<br>

_**Operative:** 5th level_<br>
When an attacker that you can see deals damage to you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

### Evasion
_**Operative:** 7th level_<br>
When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Reliable Talent
_**Operative:** 11th level_<br>
You have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Ability checks you make that let you add your proficiency bonus gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7.

### Blindsense
_**Operative:** 14th level_<br>
If you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### Slippery Mind
_**Operative:** 15th level_<br>
You have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. 

### Elusive
_**Operative:** 18th level_<br>
You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck
_**Operative:** 20th level_<br>
You have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. Your Dexterity and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2. Additionally, if your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Operative Exploits
The exploits are presented in alphabetical order. 

#### Commander's Exploit
You gain proficiency in medium armor.

#### Explorer's Exploit
You can hold your breath twice as long as you are normally able to, and take half as much damage from fall damage.



#### Fate's Exploit
_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_<br>
When you finish a short or long rest, roll a d20 and record the number rolled. Once before your next short or long rest, you can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature within 5 feet of you with this roll. You must choose to do so before the roll. 

#### Fighter's Exploit
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. 

#### Freedom's Exploit
You ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when you would use your action to break free of an effect that is grappling or restraining you, you can instead use your bonus action.

#### Guerrilla's Exploit
You only need 3 hours of sleep during a long rest to gain its benefits, instead of 6. Additionally, if your long rest would be interrupted, you only need to complete the long rest instead of restarting it to gain its benefits. Lastly, you have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion.

#### Learner's Exploit
You gain proficiency in a skill and a tool, or two tools.

You can select this exploit multiple times, each time choosing a new skill and a tool, or two new tools.

#### Mentor's Exploit
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_<br>
Once per turn, whenever both you and a friendly creature within 60 feet that can see and hear you both have to make a saving throw to resist the same effect, you can choose to have disadvantage on the save. If you do so, the friendly creature gains advantage on the save. You can use this feature before or after you both make the saving throw, but you must do so before the GM says whether the save succeeds or fails.

#### Skill's Exploit
You learn an exploit that enhances your ability to apply your knowledge to combat situations. You can take this exploit multiple times.

When you take the Attack action, you can use one of your skill exploits granted by this feature. You can use these features a combined two times. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Choose from the following. You must be proficient in the skill in order to take that skill's exploit. 

***Aim (Stealth).*** You attempt to line up a strike against a creature you can see that you are hidden from. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, you gain a +10 bonus to the first attack roll you make against the target before the end of your next turn. If your check fails, you are no longer hidden from the target.

***Angle (Perception).*** You attempt to predict the behavior of a humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll the target makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage, and the first saving throw the creature makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

***Battle Cry (Intimidation).*** You attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is frightened until the end of your next turn. If the target was already frightened of you, it must immediately drop whatever it is holding. On its next turn, if it is still frightened of you, it must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

***Charm (Persuasion).*** You attempt to convince one humanoid you can see within 30 feet that can hear and understand you. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If you have dealt damage to the creature in the last hour, it has advantage on the check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you until the start of your next turn, and it has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against a creature before the end of its next turn. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

***Confuse Beast (Animal Handling).*** You attempt to confuse one beast on the battlefield. Make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check.

***Distract (Performance).*** You attempt to distract one beast or humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Performance) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check.

***Emulate Predator (Nature).*** You attempt to emulate the sounds of a natural predator of a beast or plant you can see within 30 feet.

***Feint (Deception).*** You attempt to divert the attention of a target you can see within 30 feet. Make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the first attack roll made against the target before the start of your next turn by someone other than you has advantage, and the target has disadvantage on the first saving throw they make against an effect caused by a creature other than you before the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target can't be deceived by you in this way for 1 hour.

***Hacktivate (Technology).*** You attempt to determine the weaknesses in a droid you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn, and if you hit, you deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

***Instruct (Investigation).*** You attempt to find a weakness in your target. Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, if a friendly creature makes an attack roll against the target and they can see and hear you, you can use your reaction to grant them advantage on the roll. If you do so, and they hit, they deal additional damage equal to your bonus to Investigation checks. This damage is the same type as the attack's damage. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

***Intuit (Insight).*** You attempt to determine the motivations of one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, the target can't have advantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead can't have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws against you until the end of your next turn.

***Pocket Sand (Sleight of Hand).*** You attempt to blind one beast or humanoid you can see within 15 feet of you. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, the target is blinded until the end of your turn.

***Snare (Survival).*** You attempt to cause a creature within 30 feet of you to stumble. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Perception) check. If your check succeeds, and the target moves towards you before the start of your next turn, it gains 1 slowed level, and you can use your reaction to cause it to fall prone. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

***Spin (Piloting).*** You attempt to confound a piloted construct you can see within 30 feet. Make an Intelligence (Piloting) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Piloting) check. If your check succeeds, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn. If your check fails, the target instead has advantage on attack rolls against you, and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws against the target, until the start of your next turn.

***Study (Lore).*** You attempt to anticipate your target's action. Make an Intelligence (Lore) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn. Alternatively, before the end of your next turn, you can use your reaction to grant disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw the target makes against you. If your check fails, you instead have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll or saving throw you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.

***Tumble (Acrobatics).*** You attempt to make a quick tumble, immediately moving 10 feet. If you begin or end this movement within a creature's reach, make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by it's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from it, and you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against it before the end of your turn. If your check fails, you immediately fall prone.

***Wrestle (Athletics).*** You attempt to grab and pin a creature within 5 feet of you with at least one free hand. The target must be no more than one size larger than you. Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If your check succeeds, the target is both grappled and restrained by you. If the target stops being grappled, it also stops being restrained. If your check fails, you can't use this feature on this target again for 1 hour.

#### Technologist's Exploit
You learn and can cast one 1st-level tech power once per long rest. Your techcasting ability is Intelligence. You require use of a wristpad for this power.

You can select this exploit multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different power.

#### Weaponmaster's Exploit
You gain proficiency in three blasters or vibroweapons that lack the heavy and strength properties.

You can select this exploit multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose different weapons.

## Operative Practices
Operatives share, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes, though their practices differ. Your practice grants you features at 3rd, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

## Acquisitions Practice
Many operatives are hired for the procurement of valuable artifacts, but only the true masters of the art can slip through the tightest security and make off with untold riches, whether they do it for a profit, or for sport. Those operatives who choose the Acquisitions Practice apply a mixture of stealth and impressive acrobatics to surpass any kind of defenses they are met with.

### Fast and Agile
_**Acquisitions Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your demolitions kit or security kit to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

Additionally, climbing no longer costs you extra movement, and you gain the ability to move in flying leaps with incredible speed, precision, and power. When you move, instead of using your walking speed, you may take two short movements by flying. Each movement is at half your speed, and you must end each one on a solid object, a surface, or on the ground. If you do not, you fall and your movement ends. If you Dash, your bonus movement is applied to your normal speed, not this movement. 

### Deft Hands
_**Acquisitions Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn a number of techniques to distract and confuse your opponents. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to perform a deft hand maneuver.


Some of your deft hand maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the deft hand maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is as follows:

___


**Deft Hands save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier


___

#### Hinder
You attempt to distract your target in order to hinder their movement. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn and it makes the first Dexterity saving throw before the end of its next turn with disadvantage.

#### Pilfer
You attempt to pick your target's pockets. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on the first Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check you make against the target before the end of your next turn.

#### Tumble
You attempt to nimbly roll away. You immediately move 10 feet in a direction of your choice, and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, this movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the creature.

### Supreme Sneak
_**Acquisitions Practice:** 9th level_<br>
You have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. Additionally, as long as you aren't incapacitated, you no longer take damage from falling less than 100 feet, and have resistance to falling damage.

### Aerial Agility
_**Acquisitions Practice:** 13th level_<br>
Your agility in the air grants you the following benefits:
- When you move, you can instead take 3 short movements by flying.
- Whenever you end your flying movement and you are within 5 feet of a climbable surface, you can grab onto that surface as though you were climbing upon it.

### Thief's Reflexes
_**Acquisitions Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.

Additionally, you learn to utilize the momentum of your fall to make deadly vertical strikes. Whenever you fall at least 50 feet and land within 5 feet of an enemy creature you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against that creature. If the attack is a Sneak Attack, you can deal three additional weapon dice worth of damage and the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Deft Hands save DC or be knocked prone.

## Beguiler Practice
Those operatives who choose the Beguiler Practice augment their natural wiles and charm with subtle utilization of the Force. They tap into these powers to cloud the minds of their foes, distracting and diverting before abruptly dispatching them.

### Forcecasting
_**Beguiler Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You have derived powers from your emotional connection to the Force. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

#### Force Powers Known
You learn 4 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

#### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your operative level, as shown in the Force Points column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

#### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the Beguiler Practice Forcecasting table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.


#### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier

___

**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier


___

### Fascinating Display
_**Beguiler Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You can spend 1 minute attemping to distract and enthrall those around you. Choose a number of humanoids within 60 feet of you who watched your display for the duration, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, speaking glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it. Additionally, it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies. If a target succeeds on this saving throw, the target has no hint you tried to charm it.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

### Mesmerizing Presence
_**Beguiler Practice:** 9th level_<br>
You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures charmed by you.

### Enthralling Vigor
_**Beguiler Practice:** 13th level_<br>
Whenever a creature fails a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw against a force power or class feature you use, you can gain temporary hit points equal to half your operative level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

### Distracting Countenance
_**Beguiler Practice:** 17th level_<br>
As a bonus action, you can mask yourself with the Force for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to attack you for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, it can't attack you on this turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. On a successful save, it can attack you on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against your powers on your next turn.




Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Lethality Practice

Those operatives who choose the Lethality Practice hone their skills in the art of death. They use precise and surprising attacks to dispatch their foes with fatal efficiency.

### Assassinate
_**Lethality Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
When you hit a creature that you are hidden from with a weapon attack, you can choose to turn that hit into a critical hit. If the attack reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it does not automatically reveal your presence to any remaining creatures. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by the creatures' Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you remain hidden. If you would already be able to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to remain hidden as part of the attack, you instead gain advantage on the check.

You can use this feature once. You gain an additional use at 9th and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Lethal Strikes
_**Lethality Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn how to read your foes and strikes their weak points. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a lethal strike. 

Some of your lethal strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the lethal strike's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

**Lethal Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

___

#### Priming Attack
You attempt to prime the target. The target must make a Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw (your choice). On a failed save, the next time you deal Sneak Attack damage against the target before the end of your next turn, you roll four additional Sneak Attack dice.

#### Target Assessment
You attempt to infer crucial details about your foe. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the GM tells you two of the following characteristics of your choice:
- Highest ability score
- Lowest ability score
- Strongest saving throw
- Weakest saving throw

#### Vulnerable Strike
You attempt to stagger the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the next time you would make an attack roll against the target before the end of your next turn, you can instead force the target to make a saving throw with the ability score of your choice. On a failed save, the creature takes normal weapon damage, is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit, and you can apply your Sneak Attack damage to the roll.



### Infiltrator
_**Lethality Practice:** 9th level_<br>
You have become a master at avoiding detection.

When you or a creature within 5 feet of you fails a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you can use your reaction to allow that creature to reroll the check. It must use the new roll.

### Bushmaster
_**Lethality Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You excel at leading ambushes and acting first in a fight.

You have advantage on initiative checks. Additionally, the first creature you hit during the first round of a combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage until the start of your next turn.

### Death Strike
_**Lethality Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You've become a master of instant death. When you deal weapon damage to a creature that you are hidden from or that is surprised, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your lethal strike save DC. On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

## Sharpshooter Practice
Those operatives who choose the Sharpshooter Practice are bringers of death. Striking from a safe distance, the Sharpshooter uses precision shooting to control the battlefield and bring targets down quickly.

### Assume the Position
_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You don't need advantage on your attack roll to use your Sneak Attack if your target is greater than 30 feet from you and no enemies are within 5 feet of you. Additionally, standing up from prone now only costs 5 feet of movement.

Additionally, you gain proficiency with two martial blasters of your choice.

### Placed Shots
_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 3rd level_<br>
You perfect the art of placing distant shots for maximum effectiveness in debilitating and controlling your enemies. When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you may choose to forgo two of your Sneak Attack dice to make the attack a placed shot. 


Some of your placed shots require your target to make a saving throw to resist the placed shot's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: 

___

**Placed Shot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

___

#### Disarming Shot
You attempt to disarm a creature with your attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. The object lands at its feet.

#### Penetrating Shot
You attempt to damage another target with the same attack. Choose a second target within 15 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second target, it takes two dice worth of Sneak Attack damage.

The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

#### Suppressive Shot
You attempt to pin the target to its location. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.

### Head Shot
_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 9th level_<br>
You are at your deadliest when your enemies are unaware of the danger they are in. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet. 

Additionally, any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

### Distracting Shot
_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 13th level_<br>
You are able to defend your compatriots from afar. When a friendly creature you can see within your weapon's normal range is the target of a ranged attack, or forced to make a saving throw, and the source of the effect is within your weapon's normal range, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against the source. On a hit, instead of dealing damage, the target of your attack has disadvantage on the attack roll against your ally, or your ally has advantage on the saving throw to resist the effect.

### Double Tap
_**Sharpshooter Practice:** 17th level_<br>
You've learned to capitalize when you have the advantage. When you take the Attack action and make an attack with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do, you can make an additional attack against the target or another creature within 5 feet of it (no action required). Both attacks can benefit from your Sneak Attack damage, instead of only one.

<!--- image here <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PdcqYka.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:7px;left:-60px;width:513px;transform:scalex(-1);z-index:1000' /> --->





## Scholar
An overwhelming horde of tusken raiders bears down on a</span> chiss and her fellow adventurers. She gives the order and her allies unleash a single coordinated attack cutting deep into their lines. Under her command the enemy is quickly routed against all odds, all according to plan.

Deep within the once thought abandoned ruins, a nautolan tends to his companions wounds as they rest. Countless long nights of study and training have conditioned him to keep going even when all others have exhausted themselves. He will see them through this.

A twi'lek in fine vestments addresses a gathering crowd. What was the making of an angry mob begins to disperse, his mere presence putting them at ease, giving his companions time to make their escape. 

Scholars are master of the mundane arts, using methodical practices to turn the tables to their advantage. From years of study and testing, scholars take in the situation around them and quickly formulate the means to achieve whatever they have minds set to. Whatever pursuit they follow, a scholar will have a plan for anything that comes their way.

### The Pursuit of Knowledge
A true scholar is never satisfied. They are always seeking out a new answer to a new question. This often goes hand-in-hand with seeking a life of adventure, to explore new, hidden areas, or accompany those that do. The life of a scholar often times begins in the mundane, as a teacher or sage. Sometimes they serve as doctors, diplomats, or as officers in the military.


### To Learn, To Know
For scholars, mundane life is often too slow. When life becomes stagnant or when an answer cannot be found, the call to adventure rings louder. Scholars will often go to ancient, forgotten, and often dangerous places to find something to quench their thirst for knowledge.


<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPxvPXQ.png' style='position:absolute;top:37px;right:65px;width:330px;z-index:1000' /> --->

### Creating a Scholar
As you create a scholar, it's important to think of where you gained your knowledge. Did you serve as an apprentice under a master? Did you attend college or other formal education? Perhaps you gained it on your own, searching out and pouring over dusty tomes found in forgotten places. Where did your thirst for knowledge come from? Insatiable curiosity? Always wanting to know the right answer? Or do you have something to prove? Think about what field you wish to pursue and think of what is driving you in that direction.

#### Quick Build
You can make a scholar quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Dexterity. Second, choose the noble background.

You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice. See chapter 13 for the maneuvers list.

#### Maneuvers Known
You learn one maneuver of your choice, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the scholar table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.

Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

Your maneuver ability varies based on the type of the maneuver you use. You use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for physical maneuvers (your choice), Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for mental maneuvers (your choice), and an ability of your choice for general maneuvers.

___

### Critical Analysis
_**Scholar:** 1st level_<br>
You are able to analyze a creature, develop a plan on how to best overcome any potential obstacle, and execute that plan with ruthless efficiency. As a bonus action on your turn, you can analyze a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. For the next minute, or until you analyze another target, you gain the following benefits:
- When you analyze a hostile creature, your attack and damage rolls made with weapons with the finesse property or blaster weapons against that target may use your Critical Analysis ability modifier, which is Intelligence, instead of Strength or Dexterity. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- When you analyze a friendly creature, the target can end your Critical Analysis on them (no action required) to add your Critical Analysis ability modifier, which is Intelligence, to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once a friendly creature has benefited from this ability, they can not do so again until they complete a short or long rest.

Once within the next hour, the next time each creature would make an ability check with the chosen skill or tool, they may add their proficiency bonus to the roll if they are not already proficient. A creature may only benefit from this feature once. If a creature is targeted by this feature again before using it, they can choose to retain the first benefit or replace it with the new skill or tool instead.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 13th level, you regain the ability to use it after you complete a short or long rest.

<!--- <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/oOPlRxo.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:22px;right:70px;width:387px;transform:scaleX(-1);z-index:1000;' /> --->

## Gambler Pursuit

Not all studied men and women use their intelligence and skill for the pursuit of knowledge, but instead turn to the various casinos and betting halls of the galaxy. Those scholars who choose the Gambler Pursuit use their knowledge of probability and risk to attempt to master games of chance and build their fortune, or lose it all along the way.

### Gambler's Aptitude
_**Gambler Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency with your choice of gaming set and your choice of the Insight, Deception, Persuasion, or Sleight of Hand skills. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with them.

### Risk versus Reward
_**Gambler Pursuit:** 3rd, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
When you make your first attack on your turn against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you can decide to gamble by rolling a d6. On a roll of 4 or higher, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the start of your next turn. On a roll of 3 or lower, that creature instead has advantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn.

This die increases to d8 at 9th level, d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level.

### Lucky Number 7
_**Gambler Pursuit:** 6th level_<br>
Whenever you roll a 7 on an attack roll against the target of your Critical Analysis feature, the attack automatically hits and you regain an expended superiority die. 

When attacking with advantage or disadvantage, this effect applies if either roll is a 7. If both rolls are a 7, the attack is a critical hit.

### Tell Me the Odds
_**Gambler Pursuit:** 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
If the target of your Critical Analysis hits you with a weapon attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d8. On a 4 or higher, you impose disadvantage on the roll. If the target already had disadvantage, they must instead reroll one of the dice once (your choice).

This die increases to d10 at 13th level and d12 at 17th level.

### Borrowed Luck
_**Gambler Pursuit:** 17th level_<br>
You have gained the ability to unnaturally alter luck in your favor. Once per round, after an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check is rolled by you or a creature that you can see, you can replace the number on the d20 with a 7. Note the number on the d20 of the roll that you replaced. That number becomes your borrowed luck roll.

While you have a borrowed luck roll, you can expend it and replace any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw made by you or a creature that you can see with the value of the borrowed luck roll. You can only have one borrowed luck roll at a time, and you lose any unused borrowed luck rolls when you complete a short or long rest.

### Gambler Discoveries
When you select this pursuit, you gain access to new discoveries which reflect your deep understanding of chance. Whenever you learn a new discovery, you can choose from any of the following as well. The discoveries are listed in alphabetical order. 

#### Ace Up Your Sleeve
Whenever you make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can expend a superiority die, adding the result to your total for the check.

#### Against the House
Whenever you would make a Charisma (Persuasion) check involving haggling, you can instead challenge the target to a game of chance. If they accept your offer, you can make an ability check with an available gaming set. If you win the challenge, you automatically succeed on the Charisma (Persuasion) check.

#### Ante Up
When you roll initiative, are not surprised, and end up first in the initiative order, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action during your first turn in combat.

#### Calculated Bluff
When you make an ability check using Charisma, you can choose to instead make the check using your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice).

#### Cold Read
_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_<br>
As an action, you may make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by a target's Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you know the next action the target intends to take, so long as the situation does not change dramatically.

#### Feeling the Pressure
_**Prerequisite:** 13th level_<br>
Whenever you roll a 4 or higher on your Risk Versus Reward feature, the target of your Critical Analysis feature also has disadvantage on attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn.

#### Take a Chance
_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_<br>
Before making an attack roll, you can expend a superiority die. On a miss, you lose that superiority die and do not benefit from it in any way. On a hit, you can choose two other maneuvers that you know, and subject the target to both maneuvers, without expending additional superiority dice.

#### The Magic Number
_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_<br>
Whenever you roll a 7 on an ability check or saving throw, you can reroll the ability check or saving throw with advantage.

## Physician Pursuit

Physicians study the medical, anatomical, and biological sciences. Those scholars who choose the Physician Pursuit use their knowledge to mend their allies on the field and deal crippling blows with surgical precision.

### Medical Practitioner

Whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, you can roll an additional d6 and add it to the roll. This die increases to d8 at 9th level, d10 at 13th level, and d12 at 17th level.

Additionally, whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, if the creature is the target of your Critical Analysis, you can instead choose the maximum on both dice. Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 11th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

### Resuscitate
_**Physician Pursuit:** 9th level_<br>
Through your medical studies you have learned to delay seemingly inevitable death. As a bonus action, you can stabilize a creature you can touch that has 0 hit points. 

Additionally, as an action, you can tend to a creature you can touch that has died since the end of your last turn. The creature immediately regains 1 hit point and stabilizes. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Panacea
_**Physician Pursuit:** 17th level_<br>
You've developed the formula to concoct a cure-all miracle solution: a panacea. Over the course of 10 minutes, you can expend rare medical supplies worth 1,000 cr to create your panacea in a simple syringe. The panacea retains its potency for 24 hours. As a bonus action, a creature can use the panacea. Alternatively, as an action, they can administer it to another creature within 5 feet.

The target has its exhaustion level reduced by one and regains all of its hit points. If the target is diseased, poisoned, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends.



Once you create a panacea, you can't create another until you finish a long rest.

#### Advanced Remote Healer
_**Prerequisite:** 11th level_<br>
The range of your Remote Healer feature increases to 60 feet.

#### Experimental Treatments
Your medication and treatments are known to be untested and unstable. Immediately after you use a maneuver that causes a creature to regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, you can choose to roll on the Side Effects table to the right. The condition or effect lasts until the creature completes a long rest, or you use this feature again.

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### From the Brink
_**Prerequisite:** 7th level_<br>
If the target of your Critical Analysis feature would be reduced to 0 hp, you may use your reaction and end your Critical Analysis feature to have them be reduced to 1 hp instead. Once a creature has benefited from this feature, they must complete a long rest before they can do so again.

#### Health Advisor
Whenever a creature that is a target of your Critical Analysis feature begins their turn, you can use your reaction to give them temporary hit points equal to one-fourth your scholar level + your proficiency bonus, as shown in the scholar table, which last until the start of their next turn.

#### Patient Protector
_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_<br>
You can treat creatures within 5 feet of the target of your Critical Analysis feature as if they were also targets of your Critical Analysis.

#### Surgical Precision
_**Prerequisite:** 5th level_<br>

#### Tend the Wounded
If you or any friendly creatures you can touch regain hit points by spending one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, each of those creatures regain 1d4 extra hit points.

This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 9th level, 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.



##### Side Effects

| d20 | Side Effects  |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1  | The creature turns out to be allergic to this specific treatment. Every ability score is reduced by 1. |
| 2  | The creature starts sneezing uncontrollably. Any attack rolls with a die roll value of 19 results in a miss due to a poorly timed sneeze. |
| 3 | The creature's legs become swollen. The creature gains 1 slowed level. |
| 4 | The creature becomes one size larger or smaller. |
| 5 | The skin at their joints turns into a wooden material, giving them a bonus of +2 to AC. |
| 6 | The creature's body starts producing powerful stomach acid in high amounts. The creature can use an action to spew stomach acid in a 15 feet cone. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 17th level. | 
| 7 | The creature becomes mute and has uncontrollable gas. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on smell.|

| 9 | The creature gains advantage on perception checks based on hearing, but everything seems uncomfortably loud to them. They gain vulnerability to sonic damage. |
| 10 | The treatment slows down their brain function, reducing their Intelligence by 4.|
| 11  | The creature's skin turns dark purple. If they are already purple, they turn bright pink instead.  |
| 12  |  The creature becomes covered in sickly, green pustules. When the creature is hit by a melee attack, the attacker takes 1d4 poison damage. |
| 13 | The creature's skin starts to seriously bloat up from internal pressure build-up, and a strong impact may cause it to explode. Whenever the creature takes damage, the creature has to pass a concentration check or the creature takes kinetic damage equal to half their maximum hit points. Other creatures within 10 feet of the explosion also take a fourth of the damage. Once this explosion occurs, their skin becomes very soft. |
| 14 | The creature rapidly grows body hair all over, including the face, until they resemble a wookiee. If they are already a wookiee, the reverse effect occurs; all hair immediately falls off, leaving the skin bare. |
| 15 | The creature's body temperature fluctuates to extremes. They gain resistance to cold and fire damage.|
| 16 | The creature becomes ravenous. Every hour they haven't eaten a meal they gain a level of exhaustion. |
| 17 | The creature believes they are the chosen one. |
| 18 | The creature has a difficult time resting. The amount they heal from Hit Dice is now halved. |
| 19 | The creature's movement speed is increased by 15 feet, and opportunity attacks on them have disadvantage. |
| 20 | The creature gains 10d10 hit points, and they feel happy and carefree. |



## Politician Pursuit


Politicians study social & political sciences. Those scholars who choose the Politician Pursuit know how to best present themselves to manipulate the masses into doing their bidding or allow them and their allies to carry out their business without impediment. They also understand the importance of self-preservation for a political figure.

### Silver Tongue
_**Politician Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn your choice of two languages and your choice of Charisma skill. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with it.

### Motivating Diplomat
_**Politician Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
When you are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you and all allies within 10 feet of you gain a bonus to their AC equal to half your Critical Analysis ability modifier.

### Force of Personality
_**Politician Pursuit:** 6th level_<br>
As an action, you suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) to influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you, and it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 24 hours. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the effect ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that an officer givers her gun to the first smuggler she meets. If the condition isn't met before the effect ends, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the effect ends.

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Reassemble

When you do so, choose a number of creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you equal to your Critical Analysis ability modifier (minimum of one). They can use their reaction to immediately move a number of feet equal to their speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks, and they must end this movement closer to you than they started.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again. 



### Beguiling Presence

## Scout
Rough and grizzled looking, a human stalks alone through</span> the shadows of trees, hunting the quarry he knows is planning a raid on a nearby settlement. Clutching a techblade in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.

After tumbling away from the shrapnel of a missile's explosion, a bothan finds her feet and quick-fires two shots from her carbine at the oncoming tank. Shrugging off the wave of fear that threatens to permeate her entire being, she strafes around her foe, firing shot after shot to try to penetrate the tank's thick armor.

Glancing at his wristpad, a sullustan looks through the eyes of his tracker droid. Transmitting instructions, he sends his droid to distract the houk he's been tracking while he readies his sniper rifle for the shot.

Scouts are the first on the trail and the last to lose it, tracking their quarry for miles unimpeded. They are adaptable, wielding both tech powers and their weaponry to overcome their foes

### Deadly Hunters
Warriors in their own right, scouts specialize in tracking and hunting the monsters that threaten civilization-humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible Force-wielders, and renegade droids. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through any terrain and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Scouts focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.

Scouts acquire the ability to cast tech powers through utilization of a wristpad. Their powers, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A scout's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the civilization.

### Independent Adventurers
Though a scout might make a living as a bounty hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a scout's true calling is to defend civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in. In some places, scouts gather in secretive orders, though many scouts are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a rancor or a band of pirates attacks, a scout might be the first-and possibly the last-line of defense. This fierce independence makes scouts well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, scouts respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.

<!--- image here <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/8Nj1Jxq.png' style='position:absolute;top:22px;right:10px;width:386px;z-index:1000' /> --->

### Creating a Scout
As you create your scout character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, tracking together until you mastered the scout's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain-perhaps by some kind of bestial monstrosity on which you've sworn revenge? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of mercenaries. 

What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work, or a significant change?

What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?

#### Quick Build
You can make a scout quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability modifier, depending on whether you want to focus on melee combat or on ranged weapons (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Intelligence. Second, choose the bounty hunter background.

Additionally, once on each of your turns, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. 

### Scout Routines
The routines are presented in alphabetical order. If multiple scouts grant the same routine, affected creatures can only benefit from it once. You must be conscious to grant the benefit of your routines.

## Scout Techniques
Scouts tend to share knowledge amongst them selves, focusing on specific techniques and honing them to perfection. Your technique grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

## Bulwark Technique
Some scouts find themselves far from civilization not to hunt, gather intelligence, or escape danger, but to venture forth simply to defend those unable to defend themselves. Followers of the Bulwark Technique make use of advanced technology to contain those that threaten the undeserving.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Bulwark Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in heavy armor.

### Personal Barrier
_**Bulwark Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain access to a powerful personal barrier. Whenever you complete a short or long rest, you create a barrier on yourself that lasts until you finish a short or long rest. That barrier has hit points equal to twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier. Your barrier can never have hit points greater than twice your scout level + your Intelligence modifier.

Whenever you take damage, the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the barrier has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its power remains. Whenever you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher, your barrier regains hit points equal to the number of tech points spent.

Additionally, for as long as your barrier has hit points, you gain the following benefits:
- You are considered proficient in Constitution saving throws for the purpose of maintaining concentration on tech powers.
- Hostile creatures that hit you with melee attacks take energy damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

### Mark of the Bulwark
_**Bulwark Technique:** 3rd level_<br>
When the target of your Ranger's Quarry feature makes a melee attack against a friendly creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to force the attack to target you instead. If the attack hits, and your Personal Barrier has hit points, the attacking creature takes bonus damage equal to your Ranger's Quarry Damage Die.

### Projected Barrier
_**Bulwark Technique:** 7th, 11th, and 17th level_<br>
You've learned how to manipulate your barrier to create new effects. As an action, you can spend three of your barrier's hit points to create a unique effect. You have three such effects: Projected Sphere, Projected Maelstrom, and Projected Wave. When you use your Projected Barrier, you choose which effect to create.

Some Projected Barrier Effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

If your barrier's hit points are reduced to 0, any Projected Barrier features immediately end.

#### Projected Sphere
You create a protective spherical barrier in a 5-foot-radius sphere a point you can see within 30 feet that lasts until the start of your next turn. Creatures within the barrier have three-quarters cover from attacks originating from outside the barrier. You can maintain the barrier by spending an additional barrier hit point at the start of each of your turns (no action required).

#### Projected Maelstrom
You create an unstable energy maelstrom in a 5-foot cube at a point you can see within 30 feet that lasts until the start of your next turn. A creature takes 4d4 energy damage when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. You can maintain the barrier by spending an additional barrier hit point at the start of each of your turns (no action required). 

This feature's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 11th level (5d4) and 17th level (6d4).

#### Projected Wave
You create a wave of barrier energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature within the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 energy damage and is pushed back to the edge of the cone. On a success, they take half damage and<br> aren't pushed.

This feature's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (3d6) and 17th level (4d6).

### Regenerative Shielding
_**Bulwark Technique:** 11th level_<br>
When a hostile creature forces you to make a saving throw and you succeed, your personal barrier regains hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier.

### Adaptive Barrier
_**Bulwark Technique:** 15th level_<br>
When your personal barrier takes damage, you can have it gain resistance to subsequent damage of that type until the start of your next turn (no action required). If it takes damage of more than one type simultaneously, you can choose which type it gains resistance to. Your barrier can only have resistance to one type of damage at a time.

## Sentinel
Clad in black robes, the rattataki pulls his hood forward and</span> steps into the shadowy alcove, only to reappear further down the hall. As his quarry walks past, he presses the hilt of his lightsaber to the back of their head, quickly toggling it on-and-off. He is gone before the corpse hits the ground.

The togruta dashes across the battlefield, doublesaber deflecting blaster shots to the ground. She pulls her wounded padawan to her feet, and guides her away from the warzone.

Green-bladed lightsaber a blur, the cathar ferociously presses the attack. With each strike, she guides her opponent closer to the ravine's edge. A flurry of blows followed by a quick *force push* and her foe tumbles over the edge.

Sentinels are the masters of blending force powers with weapon attacks. They weave the two together so expertly that their foes have trouble predicting them.

### The Middle of the Road
The sentinel uses stealth and subterfuge to accomplish the will of the Force. Where the consular focuses on mastery of the Force and the guardian focuses on the mastery of the lightsaber, the sentinel focuses on merging the two. 

### Solitary Action
Sentinels are notoriously independent, most comfortable acting alone and without backup; where some use a team to make up for their weaknesses, the sentinel uses the Force to overcome theirs. While some take this independent streak to the extreme, they are usually accepting of authority, as long as they are allowed to carry out directions using their preferred methods.

### Creating a Sentinel
While creating your sentinel, consider your personal philosophy in regards to the Force and its most famous practitioners ñ the Jedi and the Sith.  Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Are you an operative tapping into a latent Force-sensitivity? Were you trained in the force from a young age, or did you discover it as an adult? How do you treat those weaker than you? What was your family like? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?

#### Quick Build
You can make a sentinel quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom or Charisma. Second, choose the Jedi or Sith background.

Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest this ideal in a brief surge of energy.

Different sentinels select different callings, called Paths, to follow as they hone their powers. Your calling grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 13th, and 18th level.

## Path of the Corsair

There may come a time when a sentinel finds themselves stranded, hunted, or in any situation where they must hide their nature as a force wielder. Those sentinels who follow the Path of the Corsair make use of alternative weaponry not commonly associated with force-wielders to great effect.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Path of the Corsair:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency with demolitions kits and three blasters of your choice.

### Corsair Munitions
_**Path of the Corsair:** 3rd level_<br>
You can throw grenades and set mines with your bonus action, instead of your action. Additionally, when you throw a grenade, you can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength when determining your throwing range. Lastly, when determining the save DC of a charge, grenade, mine, missile, or rocket you control, you can use your universal force save DC, if it would be higher than the item's DC.

### Force-Empowered Detonators
_**Path of the Corsair:** 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn to create a number of small but potent grenades. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can create two grenades. You must have a demolitions kit in order to create these grenades. Your grenades can only be used by you, and they lose their potency at the end of your next short or long rest.

Your grenades can be set to detonate on impact or with a timer that causes them to explode on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). As an action, you can prime and throw one of these grenade at a point you can see within 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. Each creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw (your choice when you generate the grenade) against your universal force save DC. A creature takes damage using your Kinetic Combat die + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The damage is force for Dexterity, necrotic for Constitution, or psychic for Wisdom.

You can make additional grenades at higher level: three at 5th level, four at 9th level, five at 13th level, and six at 17th level.

### Remote Start
_**Path of the Corsair:** 7th level_<br>
You learn to easily detonate primed explosives. As a bonus action on your turn, you can detonate a primed explosive you can see within 60 feet. Alternatively, if you take the Attack action on your turn and you are wielding a blaster weapon with which you are proficient, you can choose to shoot the explosive rather than use your bonus action to detonate it as long as you wouldn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

When you do so, the explosive immediately detonates, and you have advantage on the damage roll you make with that explosive. 

### Energized Kinetics
_**Path of the Corsair:** 13th level_<br>
Once per turn, when you deal damage with a Force-Empowered Detonator or your Double Strike feature, you can deal additional damage using your Kinetic Combat die. The damage type is force, lightning, necrotic, or psychic (your choice).

### Disorienting Detonations
_**Path of the Corsair:** 18th level_<br>
When a creature fails the saving throw against a Force-Empowered Detonator, you can spend 2 force points to subject it to one of the following conditions until the end of your next turn: blinded, deafened, ignited (1d12), shocked, or slowed.

## Path of Focus
The ways of the Force can reveal themselves to a sentinel through intense concentration and, most importantly, focus. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Focus use debilitating bursts of lightsaber strikes and force powers to exhaust their foes, crushing any hopes they had of mounting an effective defense.

### Focused Burst
_**Path of Focus:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *burst* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use The Double Strike Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action. If more than one creature would be affected, only one creature takes the additional damage. Finally, you add your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) to damage rolls with it, and creatures that succeed on their saving throw take half damage, instead of none.

### Blade Dance
_**Path of Focus:** 3rd level_<br>
When you deal damage to a creature within 5 feet of you, you can move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

### Blade Storm
_**Path of Focus:** 7th level_<br>
Your bursts become even more overwhelming. Once on your turn, when a creature takes damage from you twice, you can immediately make one additional attack against that creature (no action required). This attack uses your Kinetic Combat die instead of the weapon's damage die.

### Focused Flow
_**Path of Focus:** 13th level_<br>
Whenever you use a Force-Empowered Self feature, you may instead expend no force points and roll a d4 in place of your Kinetic Combat die.

### Master Strike
_**Path of Focus:** 18th level_<br>
&emsp;&emsp;At 18th level, your bursts can overpower even the fiercest of foes. Once on your turn, when a creature takes damage from you three times, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, it becomes stunned until the end of its next turn.


## Path of the Forceblade
Some few master their weapon in ways that differ from their peers. Those sentinels who follow the Path of the Forceblade channel the Force into their weapon, forming a unique connection that grants you greater control over the weapon; it becomes an extension of their will.

### Phasethrow
_**Path of the Forceblade:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *saber throw* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you no longer have disadvantage on the attack roll with it if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, and you can use the Double Strike Force-Empowered Self options when you cast it as your action and hit a target. Finally, when you hit a creature with the *saber throw* force power, you deal additional damage equal to half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) if it doesn't already include that modifier.

### Forceblade Bond
_**Path of the Forceblade:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn how to bond with a light- or vibro-weapon through the Force, making it part of you.

You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond, gaining the following benefits:
- You can't be disarmed of that weapon while you are conscious. 
- If the weapon is within 60 feet of you and you can see it, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to travel instantly to you. If you have a free hand, you catch the weapon. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.
- You can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls.

You can have two weapons bonded to you in this way at a time, and you can summon both of them to you with the same bonus action.

### Twin Saber Throw
_**Path of the Forceblade:** 7th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
When you cast *saber throw* while wielding your forceblade, you can attack the same target multiple times.

Additionally, when you deal damage to a creature within 30 feet of you with your forceblade, you can use your bonus action to teleport to within 5 feet of that creature and make a melee weapon attack against that creature. This attack uses your Kinetic Combat die instead of your weapon's damage die. You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.


### Disruptive Throw
_**Path of the Forceblade:** 13th level_<br>
When you are the target of a ranged attack, and the source is within range of your *saber throw* force power, you can use your reaction to throw your forceblade at the source of the attack. Make a ranged force attack. On a hit, this attack deals damage using your Kinetic Combat die instead of the weapon's damage die and you impose disadvantage on the triggering attack roll.

### Forceblade Mastery
_**Path of the Forceblade:** 18th level_<br>
You've mastered controlling your forceblade with your mind, using it to keep your enemies at bay. As an action, you can telekinetically control your forceblade and have it strike any number of creatures within 10 feet of you, spending 1 force point per target. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to weapon attack rolls with that weapon). On a failed save, it takes damage using your Kinetic Combat die + half your sentinel level, is pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone.

## Path of Shadows
In darkness, there is protection. Those sentinels who follow the Path of Shadows utilize a calculated plan, becoming masters of stealth and ambush who forgo the head-on attack for the vulnerable flank.

### Dead Silence
_**Path of Shadows:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn the *psychic charge* force power, which does not count against your total powers known. Additionally, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it, and when you hit a creature with the *psychic charge* force power and the target tries to speak, it takes additional damage equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1), and its voice does not produce sound until the end of your next turn.

### Cloak of Shadows
_**Path of Shadows:** 3rd level_<br>
You can take the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Additionally, you can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.

### Shadow Strike
_**Path of Shadows:** 7th level_<br>
You learn to strike from the shadows. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the roll. 

The extra damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th level.

### Shadow Step
_**Path of Shadows:** 13th level_<br>
You gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. While you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.

### Shadow's Wrath
_**Path of Shadows:** 18th level_<br>
Your training has taught you advanced techniques while you maneuver in the shadows. While you are hidden from your target, the first attack roll you make each round does not automatically reveal your presence. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check against your target's Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you remain hidden. If you are also invisible, you remain invisible.
