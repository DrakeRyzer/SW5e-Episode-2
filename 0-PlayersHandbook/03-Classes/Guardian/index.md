# Guardian

<img src='../../../zzImages/Classes/guardian_01.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

A dark-skinned human quickly runs down a corridor, the</span> metal armor under his grey cloak clanking with each step. He rounds the corner into the prison while the lights and power are still out, urging the weakened prisoners to escape. Just then a handful of slavers arrive and ready their blasters. The man draws and ignites a white-bladed lightsaber, ready to die for the strangers behind him. 

A sith pureblood, clad head to toe in black and red armor, charges towards a line of soldiers. Shot after shot deflects off his armor until he reaches his prey, where he unleashes his fury in a series of devastating lightsaber sweeps. 

A zabrak general dramatically leaps to his soon-to-be overrun squad, landing with a flurry of lightsaber attacks. At the arrival of this powerful Jedi, the attackers fall back.

Guardians are the master of the art of lightsaber combat. They focus on utilizing the everpresent power of the Force to enable devastating attacks, often single-handedly turning the tide of battle.

## Protector or Destroyer
An unstoppable agent of the Force, the guardian channels the power flowing through him into his weapons. Their skills with a lightsaber are unrivalled. Subduing their enemies and bolstering their allies, the guardian uses the Force to control what happens around them.


## Natural Leaders
The guardian's command of the Force lends them a powerful presence. Whether through fear and intimidation or respect and admiration, the guardian is one of the greatest generals on the battlefield. They are a symbol of power to their followers.

## Creating a Guardian
While creating your guardian, consider your attraction to the Force and its most famous practitioners Ã± the Jedi and the Sith. Are you a member of one of the two orders, or do you walk a different path? Are you a soldier tapping into a latent Force-sensitivity? Were you trained in the force from a young age, or did you discover it as an adult? How do you treat those weaker than you? What was your family like? Do you see the Force as light and dark, or an impartial river of gray?

## Quick Build
You can make a guardian quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Jedi or Sith background.

|	:--			|	--:			|
|   &emsp;Guardian  |	8d4 x 100 cr&emsp;  |

### Forcecasting
_**Guardian:** 1st level_<br>
In your meditations on the Force, you have learned powers, fragments of knowledge that imbue you with an abiding force ability. See chapter 10 for the general rules of forcecasting and chapter 11 for the force powers list.

### Force Powers Known
You learn 5 force powers of your choice, and you learn more at higher levels, as shown in the Force Powers Known column of the guardian table. You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.

### Force Points
You have a number of force points equal to your guardian level x 2, as shown in the Force Points column of the guardian table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.

### Max Power Level
Many force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the guardian table.

You may only cast force powers at 4th and 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.

### Forcecasting Ability
Your forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

___

**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

___

**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your forcecasting ability modifier

___

### Channel the Force
_**Guardian:** 1st level_<br>
You know how to channel the Force to create a unique effect. You start with your choice of one from two such effects: Cause Harm or Lend Aid. At 3rd level, your Guardian Focus grants you an additional effect. When you use your Channel the Force, you choose which effect to create.

Some Channel the Force effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your universal force save DC.

You can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Cause Harm
As an action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to sap the life from a hostile creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to your guardian level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1), or half as much on a successful one.

#### Lend Aid
As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and touch a beast or humanoid within 5 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to your guardian level + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1). Alternatively, if the beast or humanoid is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

### Force-Empowered Strikes
_**Guardian:** 2nd level_<br>
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table. 

### Fighting Style
_**Guardian:** 2nd level_<br>
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed in Chapter 6. 

### Guardian Aura
_**Guardian:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain an aura of your choice, as detailed at the end of the class description, and you gain more at higher levels, as shown in the Auras Known column of the guardian table. Your aura has a radius of 5 feet, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Aura Radius column of the guardian table.

### Guardian Focus
_**Guardian:** 3rd, 7th, 15th, and 20th level_<br>
You begin to focus your studies on a specific lightsaber form, which is detailed at the end of the class description. 

### Ability Score Improvement
_**Guardian:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_<br>
You can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
_**Guardian:** 5th level_<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Force Purity
_**Guardian:** 6th level_<br>
The Force flowing through you makes you immune to poison and disease.

### Improved Force-Empowered Strikes
_**Guardian:** 11th level_<br>
You are so in tune with the Force that all your melee weapon strikes carry the power of the Force with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage. The damage is the same type as the weapon's damage.


### Cleansing Touch
_**Guardian:** 14th level_<br>
You can use your action and expend a use of your Channel the Force ability to end one force power on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

___

## Guardian Auras
The auras are presented in alphabetical order. If multiple guardians grant the same aura, affected creatures can only benefit from it once. You must be conscious to grant the benefits of your auras.

### Aura of Conquest
Whenever a creature who is frightened of you starts its turn within 5 feet of you, its gains 4 slowed levels and takes psychic damage equal to half your guardian level.

### Aura of Conviction
You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against effects that would cause you to be charmed or frightened.

### Aura of Hatred
You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you gain a bonus to the first melee weapon damage rolls you make each round equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).

### Aura of Presence
Whenever you or a friendly creature within 5 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature can add your Wisdom modifier to the saving throw. 

### Aura of Protection
Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to take that damage instead of that creature taking it. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way.

### Aura of Vigor
Whenever a friendly creature starts its turn within 5 feet of you, that creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).

### Aura of Warding
You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you have resistance to damage from force powers.

## Guardian Foci
Different guardians focus on different lightsaber styles, called Forms, as they hone their powers. Your focus grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 15th, and 20th level.
