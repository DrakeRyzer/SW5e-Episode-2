<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/guardian_form05.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Shien/Djem So Form, also known as Perseverance Form, utilizes a force-enhanced strength to overwhelm opponents. Those guardians who focus on Shien/Djem So Form actively attempt to force an opening rather than waiting for the opportunity to present itself.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in heavy armor.

### Form Basics
_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain your choice of the Shien or Djem So lightsaber form, detailed in Chapter 6. If you already know the chosen form, you can instead choose another lightsaber form.

### The Way of the Krayt Dragon
_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 3rd level_<br>
As a bonus action, you can take a threatening stance for one minute. While in this stance, the first time you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength each turn, you can choose to deal additional damage equal to your Strength modifier. If there is another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach, you can attempt to deal the additional damage to that creature instead. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Channel the Force
_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain one of the following Channel the Force options. Choose Blade Barrier for Shien or Falling Avalanche for Djem So.

#### Blade Barrier
On your turn, when you deal melee weapon damage that includes your Strength modifier, you can forgo your Strength modifier to the damage roll, expend a use of your Channel the Force (no action required), and reduce your speed by half. If you do so, energy and kinetic damage you take from weapons before the end of your next turn is reduced by an amount equal to your Strength modifier. You can not use this feature if you have moved more than half your speed this turn.

#### Falling Avalanche
On your turn, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force (no action required) and reduce your speed by half to gain advantage on the next ability check or attack roll you make using Strength before the end of your next turn. You can not use this feature if you have moved more than half your speed this turn.

### Determination
_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 7th level_<br>
You gain one of the following features. Choose Aggressive Negotiations for Shien or Reliable Vigor for Djem So.

#### Aggressive Negotiations
You gain proficiency in Intimidation or Persuasion. Additionally, while you are wielding a weapon with which you are proficient, you can't have disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks, and if the target would make a contested check, they can't have advantage on it.

#### Reliable Vigor
If the d20 result for a Strength check or saving throw is less than your guardian level, you can use your guardian level in place of the result. You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Presence
_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 15th level_<br>
You gain one of the following features. Choose Precise Reflection for Shien or Brutal Strikes for Djem So.

#### Precise Reflection
When you hit with an attack made by the *saber reflect* power, you can expend force points to deal additional damage to the target, which is the same type as the weapon's damage. The additional damage is 1d8 for each point spent in this way. You can't deal more additional damage than the amount shown in the Focused Strikes column of the guardian table.

#### Brutal Strikes
The Force flowing through you grants you incredible strength. Your Force-Empowered Strikes and Improved Force-Empowered Strikes damage rolls gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7. Additionally, when you spend force points to use your Force-Empowered Strikes feature, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice the number of points spent.

### Master of Perseverance
_**Shien/Djem So Form:** 20th level_<br>
Your might overwhelms even the most implacable of foes. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 2. Your maximum for these scores increases by 2. Additionally, you can use your action to gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage from unenhanced weapons.
- Once per turn, when you hit with a melee weapon attack using Strength, you can use your Force-Empowered Strikes feature at 1st-level without expending force points. You gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt.
- When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to make a single weapon attack with advantage against that creature. If the attack hits, you impose disadvantage on the triggering attack roll.

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
