## Politician Pursuit

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/scholar_politician.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Politicians study social & political sciences. Those scholars who choose the Politician Pursuit know how to best present themselves to manipulate the masses into doing their bidding or allow them and their allies to carry out their business without impediment. They also understand the importance of self-preservation for a political figure.

### Silver Tongue
_**Politician Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn your choice of two languages and your choice of Charisma skill. Additionally, you can't have disadvantage on checks you make with it.

### Motivating Diplomat
_**Politician Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
When you are the target of your Critical Analysis feature, you and all allies within 10 feet of you gain a bonus to their AC equal to half your Critical Analysis ability modifier.

### Force of Personality
_**Politician Pursuit:** 6th level_<br>
As an action, you suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) to influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you, and it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 24 hours. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the effect ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that an officer givers her gun to the first smuggler she meets. If the condition isn't met before the effect ends, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the effect ends.

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Reassemble
_**Politician Pursuit:** 9th level_<br>
You may use to a bonus action to call your allies towards you. When you do so, choose a number of creatures that you can see within 60 feet of you equal to your Critical Analysis ability modifier (minimum of one). They can use their reaction to immediately move a number of feet equal to their speed. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks, and they must end this movement closer to you than they started.

Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again. 

### Beguiling Presence
_**Politician Pursuit:** 17th level_<br>
Humanoids within 60 feet are particularly susceptible to your presence. Humanoids within range have disadvantage on saving throws against any charm or fear effects that originate from you.

The target must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver save DC. On a failed save, until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do.

During this time you can use your reaction to force the creature to use its reaction.
