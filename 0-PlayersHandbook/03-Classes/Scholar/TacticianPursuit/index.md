<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/scholar_tactician.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Tacticians study strategy and the ways of war. Those scholars who choose the Tactician Pursuit train themselves and their allies in combat maneuvers to deftly eliminate their foes through clever positioning, and fierce, timely attacks.

## Battle Display
_**Tactician Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in martial blasters and martial vibroweapons. 

## Tactical Mastery
_**Tactician Pursuit:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to better command your allies to victory from afar. Your Critical Analysis range is increased to 90 feet. 

## Fire as One
_**Tactician Pursuit:** 6th level_<br>
You can focus your target down with the help with an ally. Once per round, whenever the creature that is the target of your Critical Analysis feature is attacked by someone other than you, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against them. 

## Battlefield Survey
_**Tactician Pursuit:** 9th level_<br>
You become a master at leading your allies around in a battlefield you have studied. When you spend 10 minutes observing an area that is within 120 feet from you, or by using a detailed map, select a number of creatures up to your Critical Analysis ability modifier. You and those selected allies ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in that area. 



## All-Out Attack
_**Tactician Pursuit:** 17th level_<br>
You can use your action to initiate an all-out attack. Choose a number of allies up to your Critical Analysis ability modifier within 60 feet who can see or hear you. The chosen allies may then immediately use their reaction to make one weapon attack against a target of your choice. You may choose the target for each attack separately.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
