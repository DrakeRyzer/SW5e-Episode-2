# Way of the Sage

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/consular_sage.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

The rejuvenating power of the Force is incredible, and the consular is the master of this usage. Those consulars who follow the Way of the Sage assist with an array of healing powers that grant allies the strength to continue through even the harshest of encounters. Separated from the heart of the fray, the sage can be an unfailing warden to those in need.

## Disciple of Life
_**Way of the Sage:** 3rd level_<br>
When you cast a force power that restores hit points, you can use Wisdom or Charisma as your forcecasting ability for it. 

Additionally, whenever you use a force power of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains extra hit points equal to 2 + the power's level.

## Preserve Life
_**Way of the Sage:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
As an action, you can channel the Force and evoke healing energy that restores a number of hit points equal to five times your consular level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its hit point maximum. This feature has no effect on droids or constructs.

You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Blessed Healer
_**Way of the Sage:** 10th level_<br>
The healing powers you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a force power that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the power's level.

## Blessed by the Force
_**Way of the Sage:** 14th level_<br>
You gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a bonus action when you have fewer than half your hit points remaining, you can regain a number of hit points equal to half your hit point maximum.

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Supreme Healing
_**Way of the Sage:** 18th level_<br>
When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a power, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For instance, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
