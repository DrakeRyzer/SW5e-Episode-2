## Armormech Engineering

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/engineer_armormech.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Those engineers who choose the Armormech Engineering discipline focus on the ability to work with hard metals and electronic shielding to construct and enhance all types of personal armor.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Armormech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in armormech's implements, medium armor, and heavy armor. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with armormech's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

### Modified Armor
_**Armormech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to modify one unenhanced suit of armor or shield utilizing your armormech knowledge. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify one suit of armor or a shield. You must have the armor or shield and armormech's implements in order to perform this modification.



Your modified armor or shield is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified armor has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

At 9th level, you can maintain both a modified suit of armor and shield. Each modified item has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table.

### Damage Absorption
_**Armormech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
When you take damage, you can use your reaction and expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to absorb some of that damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.

### Extra Attack
_**Armormech Engineering:** 6th level_<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.

### Armormech's Celerity
_**Armormech Engineering:** 14th and 17th level_<br>
When you take the Attack action or use your action to a cast a tech power of 1st-level or higher, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Suit Reliability
_**Armormech Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
Your suit is like a second skin. Ability checks and saving throws you make that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution gain a minimum roll threshold, discussed in chapter 7. You must be wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain this benefit.

A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the harpoon. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the harpoon. Removing the harpoon requires a Strength check. While the harpoon is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.

While the harpoon is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is larger than you. A creature or object your size or smaller is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the harpoon as an action.

### Heavy Suit

On a failed save, the creature's weapon adheres to the shield. As an action, a creature can repeat this check. On a success, the weapon is freed. 

#### Overload Shield

Your armor regains 1 minute of air for every minute that you are not submerged and the armor is not sealed.

Additionally, while you are wearing your modified armor you are considered adapted to cold and hot climates as well as high altitude, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
