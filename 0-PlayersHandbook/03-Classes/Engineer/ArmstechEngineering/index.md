# Armstech Engineering

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/engineer_armstech.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Those engineers who choose the Armstech Engineeering discipline focus on the skill of constructing and modifying blasters and vibroweapons.

## Bonus Proficiencies
_**Armstech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in armstech's implements, medium armor, martial blasters, and martial vibroweapons. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with armstech's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

## Modified Weaponry
_**Armstech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to modify one unenhanced weapon with which you are proficient utilizing your armstech experience. Over the course of a long rest, you can modify the weapon. You must have the weapon and armstech's implements in order to perform this modification.

Your modified weapon is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your modified weapon has 4 modification slots, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.

At 9th level, you can maintain two modified weapons. Each modified weapon has modification slots as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table.

## Close Call
_**Armstech Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
When you make an attack roll with your modified weapon and miss, you can expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to attempt to turn that miss into a hit. Roll the die and add it to the attack roll. 

## Armstech's Strike
_**Armstech Engineering:** 6th level_<br>
Once per round, when you deal damage to a creature with your modified weapon, you can increase the damage by 1d6. The damage is of the same type as the weapon's damage.

The damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th level.


## Targeting Matrix
_**Armstech Engineering:** 14th and 17th level_<br>
When you cast a tech power that allows you to force creatures in an area to make a saving throw, you can instead make an attack roll with your modified weapon against a single target that would be in the range of the power. On a hit, the target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw. If the power would affect more than one creature, it instead affects only one.

You can use this feature five times. You gain an additional use at 17th level. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Armstech's Salvo
_**Armstech Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
When you use your Targeting Matrix feature, and the tech power would affect more than one creature, you can instead attack each affected creature that would be in the range of the power. Make a separate attack roll for each target. On a hit, each target suffers the effects as though they failed their saving throw.
