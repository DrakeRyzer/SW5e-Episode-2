## Gadgeteer Engineering

<img src='../../../../zzImages/Classes/engineer_gadgeteer.png' style='float:right; width:400px;'>

Those engineers who choose the Gadgeteer discipline focus on the ability to craft reusable consumables and items that augment and complement their techcasting abilities.

### Bonus Proficiencies
_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You gain proficiency in gadgeteer's implements. Additionally, when you engage in crafting with gadgeteer's implements, the rate at which you craft doubles.

### Gadgeteer Harness
_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
You learn to create and modify adventuring gear utilizing your gadgeteer experience. Over the course of a long rest, you can create your modified gadgeteer harness. You must have gadgeteer's implements in order to perform this modification.

Your gadgeteer harness is enhanced, requires attunement, can only be used by you, and counts as a tech focus for your tech powers while you are attuned to it. Your gadgeteer harness has 4 modification slots to which you can affix gadgets, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Modification Slots column of the engineer table. For each modification installed in excess of your proficiency bonus, your tech point maximum is reduced by 1. Over the course of a long rest, you can install, replace, or remove a number of modifications up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Some modification effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your tech save DC.


### Projected Barrier
_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 3rd level_<br>
As a bonus action while wearing your gadgeteer harness, you can expend a use of your Potent Aptitude to project a barrier on a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet. A creature can only have one barrier active at a time.

### Environmental Barrier
You project an environmental barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + your engineer level. Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, or sonic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage. 

### Physical Barrier
You project a physical barrier that lasts until the end of your next short or long rest. The barrier has a number of hit points equal to the amount rolled on your Potent Aptitude die + half your engineer level. Whenever a creature with this barrier takes damage (one of energy, ion, or kinetic, chosen by you when you activate the effect), the barrier takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the barrier to 0 hit points, the creature take any remaining damage. 

### Versatile Direction
_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level_<br>
You can take a second bonus action on each of your turns. You can use this feature three times. You gain an additional use at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Reinforced Barriers
_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 14th level_<br>
When you cast a tech power while you have a barrier active, you can restore hit points to the barrier, provided it is within 30 feet of you. You restore a number of hit points equal to twice the power's level, or 1 hit point for an at-will power. This can't increase a barrier's hit points above its initial hit points. If you have multiple barriers active, you can divide these hit points between them as you see fit.

### Adaptive Barrier
_**Gadgeteer Engineering:** 18th level_<br>
When a creature who has one of your barriers within 30 feet of you that you can see takes damage, and that damage is of a type that could be affected by that barrier, you can use your reaction to grant them resistance to the triggering damage. If that damage is the same type as the barrier's chosen damage, you instead grant them immunity. Whether resistance or immunity, the barrier immediately drops to 0 hit points.

At the end of each of your turns, a deployed sentry automatically targets a hostile creature within 10 feet of it. If multiple targets are available, one is chosen at random. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d4 energy damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of your next turn. If a creature would be targeted by more than one of these sentries, it only makes this saving throw once, taking an additional d4 damage for each sentry beyond the first.

If the target requires a saving throw, the target has disadvantage. 

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover the hook.



### Stealth Field Generator
_**Prerequisite:** 9th level_<br>
You create an augmented belt that functions as a portable, personal cloaking device. Activating or deactivating the generator requires a bonus action and, while active, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks that rely on sight. The generator lasts for 1 minute. This effect ends early if you make an attack or cast a force- or tech- power.

Once the belt has been activated, it can't be activated again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Shocking Barrier

### Wrist-Mounted Grappling Hook
You craft a wrist-mounted grappling hook weapon attached to a tightly coiled cord. With this contraption, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a range of 30/60. On a hit, it deals 1d4 kinetic damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.

A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the hook. As an action, a creature can attempt to remove the hook. Removing the hook requires a Strength check. While the hook is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cable.

While the hook is deployed, you can use your bonus action to activate the reel, pulling yourself to the location if the target is your size or larger. A creature or object smaller than you is pulled to you. Alternatively, you can opt to release the cable (no action required).

Once you've used this feature, you can't use it again until you recover and reinsert the hook as an action.
