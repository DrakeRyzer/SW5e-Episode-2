## Biology and Appearance
Weequays are humanoids with thick, leathery skin that ranges in color from tan to dark brown. Their faces are lipless, with a frill along each of their jowls.

## Society and Culture
Weequays have the ability to communicate with members of their own clan through smell by exuding complex pheromones. This pheromonal language can not be understood by any other species, or even by Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses can even tell that two Weequay are communicating. Since each Weequay's pheromones are unique, Weequay have no need for a name within their clan. As a result, speech is only a secondary form of communication for Weequay, and they seldom speak a whole sentence, resulting in Humans mistakenly believing the species to be unintelligent.

Male Weequay often tie their hair into a long braid each year spent away from their homeworld as a tribute to their home. When they returned, they shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutts were often very close to their homeworld, and would only have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually bald, and did not follow this tradition.

## Names
Only Weequay who have to live among other clans, or among non-Weequay, take a personal name. Even then, some are simply referred to as "Weequay". In Weequay culture, individual identity is much less important than the clan. As long as the clan survives, a single Weequay is expendable. This results in a sometimes brutal culture.

**Male Names.** Chublu, Fah, Kreakk, Og-Rollo, Yurrenn

**Female Names.** Gila, Qommi, Palsa, Sex, Xelror

**Surnames.** Britreg, Dlur, Klanz, Maub, Semu
